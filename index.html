<p>-	Wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water, and rinse the area for up to 15 minutes. </p>
<p>-	Allow small wounds such as punctures to bleed freely. There is no evidence that additional squeezing or “milking” of the puncture site is beneficial in preventing infection. </p>
<p>-	Control more severe bleeding with direct compression on the wound with sterile dressings. </p>
<p>-	Wear latex/rubber gloves to prevent exposure to biohazards/Blood/Body fluids. </p>
<p>-	The application of antiseptics or disinfectants may be beneficial, however, avoid the use of bleach and other disinfecting agents that are caustic to the skin. </p>
<p>-	If necessary call 911 for assistance and transportation to nearby recognized hospital. </p>
<p>-	Report the incident to the laboratory supervisor/Principal Investigator and to the Institution Occupational Safety and Health and Services report form. </p>

<h2>3.6: PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTS (PPEs) </h2>
<p>-	Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other accessories worn as a barrier against laboratory hazards. </p>
<p>-	Examples of PPE include laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, safety glasses, face shields, masks and respirators. </p>
<p>-	The appropriate use of PPE is only one of a variety of different strategies used to increase personal safety in the laboratory. </p>
<p>-	It must be recognized that the use of PPE does not eliminate the hazard nor can it compensate for poor technique or disregard for established safety practices.</p>
<p>-	However, when PPE is used correctly and as a supplement to the diligent use of good laboratory techniques and practices, it can further minimize the risk of personal exposure to hazardous materials in the laboratory. </p>
<p>-	Where there is a risk of personal exposure to hazardous materials, primary barriers such as a chemical fume hood, a biosafety cabinet, a Plexiglas splash guard or other engineering controls are used as the first level of protection.</p>
<p>-	When these primary barriers are not sufficient to prevent personal exposure, they should be supplemented with appropriate PPE. </p>
<p>-	In some situations where it is impractical to use a biosafety cabinet or other engineering controls, personal protective equipment may form the primary barrier between an individual and hazardous or infectious materials. </p>
<p>-	As with all other engineering and work practice controls the selection and use of PPE should be based upon a risk assessment of the hazards associated with the specific laboratory procedure that is being performed. </p>
<p>-	For example gloves should be worn when it can be reasonably expected that hands may come into contact with hazardous materials. </p>
<p>-	Similarly, a face shield/mask should be worn to protect the face, eyes, nose, and mouth, if a procedure that may generate a splash cannot be performed safely behind an engineered splash guard. </p>
<p>-	While protection of individuals working in the laboratory is the foremost consideration for the use of PPE, protecting experiments from contamination by the worker may also be used as justification for the use of PPE. This may include the use of PPE for invasive/surgical procedures, sensitive bioassays or PCR experiments. </p>
<p>-	Regardless of the reason for wearing PPE, it should be removed when experiments are completed and should never be worn outside the laboratory. </p>
<p>-	Finally, it should be noted that inappropriate use of PPE defeats its intended purpose and may increase risk. For example, failing to remove contaminated gloves before touching clean surfaces may expose others in the laboratory to risk; wearing a lab coat outside the laboratory may spread contamination to public areas; or using a respirator designed for use with chemical solvents will not protect the wearer from hazardous particulates. </p>

<h3>3.6.1: LABORATORY COAT:</h3>
<p>4.	Laboratory coats are available in a variety of different materials and fabrics and are principally worn to protect clothing and arms from inadvertent contamination while working in the laboratory. </p>
<p>5.	It is important to choose a coat based on the level of protection that is needed. For example a lab coat worn to protect against spilled or splashed liquids should be capable of preventing liquids from soaking through and contaminating an individual’s clothing or skin. </p>
<p>6.	If there are specific concerns about a splash to the front of the coat, a solid front gown or an apron worn in conjunction with a laboratory coat may be a more appropriate choice. </p>
<p>7.	Similarly, Many laboratory coats, particularly disposable coats made from synthetic material may offer very little protection if they come into contact with a heat source. If exposure to open flames or other heat sources is a concern, laboratory coats designated as fire resistant (FR) should be considered. </p>
<p>8.	Laboratory coats with knit or closed cuffs are preferred since they reduce the possibility of hanging cuffs coming into contact with hazardous materials and can offer more protection for the wrist and lower arm. For critical work where it is essential to prevent exposures to the lower arm, gloves can be easily pulled over the sleeve of a lab coat with a knit cuff. </p>
<p>9.	Laboratory coats should be discarded or laundered when they become soiled or contaminated. Laboratory coats that are grossly contaminated with infectious material should be disinfected immediately with either a chemical disinfectant or by autoclaving before they are laundered or disposed of as decontaminated waste. Disposable lab coats are recommended in situations where there are no departmental or laboratory facilities for laundering. Lab coats should not be taken home for laundering. </p>

<h3>3.6.2: GLOVES: </h3>
<p>1.	There is no single glove type that is suitable for all applications. Like all other PPE, gloves should be selected and used based upon the hazards and specific requirements of the procedure being performed. </p>
<p>2.	For example, delicate work requires the use of thin, flexible gloves (alternatives to latex gloves should be available); chemically resistant gloves are required when handling solvents; and thermally resistant gloves are needed when operating autoclaves or storing/retrieving materials at ultra-low temperatures. </p>
<p>3.	In addition to the general hazards that may be encountered in any laboratory, biology and microbiology laboratories may have specific hazards associated with infectious agents or other biological materials that require the use of gloves. These hazards include but are not limited to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens classified as risk group 2/BSL-2 (or greater) or toxins derived from biological sources. </p>
<p>4.	Gloves are also specifically recommended for recombinant DNA work involving organisms from risk group 2/ BSL-2 (or greater) or DNA sequences derived from these organisms. For all other work involving recombinant DNA, gloves may be worn as a method of protecting experiments from personal and environmental contamination. </p>
<p>5.	Additionally, Blood borne Pathogen Standard requires the use of gloves when it can be reasonably expected that hands may come into contact with blood or blood products and otherwise potentially infectious material such as human cell lines. </p>
<p>6.	Gloves are not specifically required when working with Risk Group 1/BSL-1 organisms, defined as well characterized agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans and present minimal potential risk to laboratory personnel and the environment. </p>
<p>7.	However, Glove selection and use should always be based on an appropriate risk assessment. For example, gloves are required for work with these organisms if:</p>
<p>a.	The skin on the hands is broken, dry or cracked or if a rash is present; </p>
<p>b.	Hazardous materials (chemical, radioactive, etc.) are used in conjunction with the risk group 1 agent; or </p>
<p>c.	An individual has a condition that may increase their susceptibility to infection</p>
<p>8.	The following apply to the use of gloves as PPE in the laboratory: </p>
<p>a.	Select and use gloves that are appropriate for the procedure. </p>
<p>b.	Never touch your eyes, nose, mouth or your face while wearing gloves. </p>
<p>c.	To prevent the spread of contamination gloves must be removed before touching “clean” surfaces such as door knobs, computer keyboards, books, telephones/cell phones, etc. This rule applies to gloves worn to protect the user as well as gloves worn to protect the experiment. </p>
<p>d.	Do not wash or reuse disposable gloves. </p>
<p>e.	Dispose of single use gloves properly. For example, gloves that are contaminated with infectious agents or otherwise potentially infectious materials should be discarded as biological waste and autoclaved before their ultimate disposal as decontaminated medical/biological waste. Gloves contaminated with other materials (chemical, radioactive, etc.,) should also be disposed of according to the risk. </p>
<p>f.	Gloves must be changed when they become contaminated, or if they are torn, punctured or otherwise compromised. </p>
<p>g.	For critical experiments such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments, gloves should be changed often to avoid cross contamination between samples. </p>
<p>h.	Gloves must be removed in a manner that prevents the unintentional transfer of hazardous or infectious material from the outside contaminated surfaces of the glove to unprotected skin or clothing </p>
<p>i.	Consider wearing two pair of gloves for particularly hazardous work as this permits removal of a contaminated outer glove with minimal risk of exposure. </p>
<p>j.	Gloves must not be worn outside the laboratory. If a hazardous material or sensitive experiment needs to be transported to another laboratory, it should be placed into a secondary container that can be safely handled without gloves. </p>
<p>k.	Gloves must be removed and hands washed when tasks are completed and before leaving the laboratory. The importance of proper gloving techniques and frequent and thorough hand washing is emphasized. Care should be taken when manipulating faucet handles to prevent contamination of cleaned hands. </p>

<h3>3.6.3: EYE AND FACE PROTECTION:</h3>
<p>1.	Eye and face protection such as safety glasses, goggles, face shield or similar PPE are worn when it can be reasonably expected that a splash or spray of infectious or other hazardous material may occur. </p>
<p>2.	Most importantly, all procedures, especially those requiring the use of hazardous materials, should be conducted in a manner that minimizes the creation of splashes, sprays or aerosols. </p>
<p>3.	These procedures may include but are not limited to pipetting, centrifuging, grinding, blending, shaking, mixing, sonicating, filtration using vacuum/pressure or opening containers of infectious or hazardous materials. </p>
<p>4.	Where there is a risk for a splash or spray, primary barriers such as a chemical fume hood, biosafety cabinet, plexiglas splash guard or other engineering controls are used as the first level of protection. When these primary barriers are not sufficient to prevent personal exposure, they should be supplemented with PPE specifically designed to protect the eyes and face. </p>
<p>5.	The following apply to the use of eye and face protection in the laboratory: </p>
<p>a.	Select eye and face protection that is appropriate to the task being performed. </p>
<p>b.	Do not put on or remove face/eye protection while wearing gloves that are potentially contaminated. </p>
<p>c.	Individuals who wear contact lenses in the laboratory should also wear eye protection. Contact lenses do not provide protection to the eyes. Foreign material splashed into the eye may become trapped under the contact lens and result in more serious injury. </p>
<p>d.	If eye protection is deemed necessary in a laboratory, then an emergency eyewash station should also be available. </p>
<p>e.	Eye and face protection must be decontaminated and cleaned before reuse or disposed of with other contaminated laboratory waste. </p>
<p>f.	When hazardous or infectious materials must be handled outside of a biosafety cabinet, or other containment device, eye and face protection must be worn if there is a possibility that the procedure may create a splash or spray of harmful material. </p>

<h3>3.6.4: MASKS AND RESPIRATORS: </h3>
<p>The following information is given as guidance for the selection masks and respirators for use in the laboratory. As with other PPE, their use in the laboratory is based upon a risk assessment of the hazards associated with the specific procedure(s) being performed. </p>

<h4>3.9.4.1: Surgical Masks </h4>
<p>1.	Surgical masks do not provide respiratory protection against harmful/infectious aerosols, smoke or chemical fumes. </p>
<p>2.	Although they may be used to protect the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from a splash or spray of hazardous liquid. </p>
<p>3.	Other alternatives such as an engineered splash guard acting as a primary barrier or a face shield worn as PPE will provide superior protection in most situations. </p>

<h4>3.9.4.2: Respirators </h4>
<p>1.	While respirators can reduce the risk of exposure to inhalational hazards, their use should be considered only as a last resort or a temporary control measure. </p>
<p>2.	In most laboratory situations a biological safety cabinet, a chemical fume hood or a similar engineering control will offer more effective protection against exposure. </p>
<p>3.	Accordingly, engineering controls, as well as administrative and work practice controls (written policies, rules, standard operating procedures, supervision, training, etc) should be put into place before respirator use is taken into consideration. </p>
<p>4.	Consequently all requests for respirator use to control exposure to hazardous biological aerosols are reviewed on case by case basis Recommendations for respirator use will be based on a laboratory risk assessment, best available practices, current knowledge and professional judgment.</p>

<h3>3.6.5: FOOTWEAR:</h3>
<p>1.	Open-toed shoes are not permitted in the laboratory. Protective footwear such as shoe covers may be necessary to minimize contamination of the laboratory and prevent the accidental release of recombinant and biohazardous materials from a laboratory. </p>
<p>2.	If disposable shoe covers are used in the laboratory, waste containers must be available to dispose of used shoe covers.</p>
<p>3.	Shoe covers must not be reused.</p>

<h2>3.7: PIPETTING</h2>
<p>-	Pipetting is the act of transferring, measuring or dispensing a liquid through a small piece of apparatus typically consisting of a narrow tube. </p>
<p>-	Pipettes can be constructed of a variety of glass or plastic materials. </p>
<p>-	Liquids can be drawn into the pipet through the use of hand-held bulbs, manual pipette aids, motorized pipette aids, or various other vacuum sources. </p>
<p>-	Pipetting is a routine function in most laboratories; therefore, the safety concerns must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>-	The following safety rules must be followed when using pipettes:</p>
<p>-	Never pipette by mouth.</p>
<p>-	Visually inspect the pipette prior to inserting it into any pipette aid. Make sure the pipette does not have any cracks.</p>
<p>-	Always dispose of pipettes in hard walled containers.</p>
<p>-	Routinely clean and inspect pipette aids and bulbs. Damaged pipette aids and weakened bulbs must be discarded.</p>
<p>-	Motorized pipette aids should have some type of filter (typically 0.45 μm or 0.22 μm) to prevent liquid from accidentally being drawn into the housing.</p>

<h2>3.8: LABORATORY EQUIPMENTS: </h2>
<h3>3.8.1: BIOLOGICAL SAFETY CABINETS: </h3>
<p>When properly installed and certified, the biological safety cabinets (BSCs) listed in the table below may be used for work in BSL 1, BSL 2 and BSL 3 laboratories. As indicted these BSCs provide varying degrees of protection when working with infectious or toxic materials. Small or minute amounts of volatile chemicals (as indicated in the table below) may only be used if the BSC is exhausted to the outside though an in-line charcoal filter and is equipped with an explosion proof motor and electrical components. BSCs DO NOT provide the same level of protection as a chemical fume hood when working with volatile or other hazardous chemicals and should not be used as a substitute for a chemical fume hood. Similarly, a chemical fume hood will not provide adequate protection when working with infectious agents and other hazardous biological materials.</p>

<h4>3.8.1.1: Preparing for work in the BSC </h4>
<p>1.	Before starting work in the BSC, review all procedures that will be used; identify the necessary equipment and materials that will be needed and develop a plan for safe and efficient work. </p>
<p>2.	If the cabinet is not running, turn on the blower and fluorescent lights and turn off the UV light if it is on. </p>
<p>3.	Verify that the BSC is operating correctly: </p>
<p>1.	Check the instrument display/gauges for operational status. </p>
<p>2.	Check the intake and exhaust grills for obstructions. </p>
<p>3.	Check that the sash is in the appropriate position. </p>
<p>4.	Check for the inward flow of air at the face of the BSC by holding a tissue near the bottom edge of the sash. </p>

<p>5.	Wipe down the interior surfaces of the cabinet with an appropriate disinfectant such as 70% ethanol, WEX-CIDE, a 1:100 dilution of household bleach (0.05% sodium hypochlorite) or another suitable disinfectant. Note that bleach, although an excellent and inexpensive disinfectant, will react with stainless steel surfaces of the hood and must be followed with a rinse of sterile water or 70% ethanol. </p>
<p>6.	Load the cabinet with materials that will be needed for the procedure, wiping their surfaces with 70% ethanol to minimize the introduction of contaminants into the BSC. Position the materials near the back of the hood and organize them in a manner that will allow for the separation of clean and contaminated items during your work in the hood. Only materials needed for immediate work should be place in the cabinet. Extra supplies (gloves, culture flasks/plates should be stored outside the cabinet). </p>
<p>7.	Define a work area 4 to 5 inches behind the front grill of the hood. This area may be covered with a plastic-backed absorbent liner to minimize the effects of splatter and aerosol generation and to facilitate clean-up in the event of a spill. The liner may be moistened with an appropriate disinfectant to promote aseptic conditions within the cabinet. </p>
<p>8.	Before beginning your work, allow the hood to run for a minimum of 5 minutes to purge any airborne contaminates from the work area. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.2: Working in the BSC </h4>
<p>1.	Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). At a minimum, a lab coat with close-fitting sleeves and gloves should be worn. Because it is appropriate to wash your hands after removing gloves, double-gloving is a good option if you anticipate the need for glove changes during your work or in the event of a spill a double pair of gloves adds an additional layer of personal protection. </p>
<p>2.	Proper aseptic technique is essential. The BSC will prevent aerosol contamination but will not prevent contact transfer resulting from poor technique. </p>
<p>3.	Avoid rapid, sweeping movements of the arms into or out of the cabinet. Move items into our out of the cabinet slowly and perpendicular to the face of the cabinet to minimize disturbance to the protective curtain of air. </p>
<p>4.	Do not block the air flow in the BSC by resting you arms or placing discarded plastic wrappers, procedure notes or other materials on the grill at the front of the BSC. </p>
<p>5.	Organize your work to maintain a separation of clean materials from materials that have become contaminated during use. </p>
<p>6.	Provide a container(s) within the BSC for the collection of contaminated waste and other materials. Repeated movement out of the hood to discard pipettes or other waste materials can disrupt airflow in the cabinet and marginalize the protection to both the individual working at the BSC and to the cultures that are being manipulated. </p>
<p>1.	Low profile, horizontal containers are preferable to vertical containers as they are less obstructive to airflow in the cabinet. </p>
<p>2.	Contaminated items that will not be reused may be placed into small biohazard bag or a similar container. </p>
<p>3.	If chemical disinfection will be used for the decontamination of reusable items an appropriate disinfectant should be poured into the discard container prior to use.</p>
<p>4.	Alternatively. If contaminated materials will be sterilized by autoclaving add enough water to the discard pan to ensure that sufficient steam is generated during autoclaving. </p>
<p>7.	Do not work with open flames or other heat sources. These generate heated convection currents that may disrupt the smooth flow of air in the hood and may also damage the hood’s HEPA filters. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.2: Completion of work in the BSC </h4>
<p>1.	Discard all waste materials generated by your work into appropriate containers inside the BSC. Close or cover all open containers. </p>
<p>2.	Allow the cabinet to run for 3 to 5 minutes with no activity. </p>
<p>3.	Disinfect the surfaces of all materials, equipment and containers that will be removed from the BSC, to minimize subsequent contamination in the laboratory. </p>
<p>4.	Remove contaminated gloves and dispose of them appropriately </p>
<p>5.	After putting on a clean pair of gloves, remove all materials for the BSC. </p>
<p>6.	Wipe down all interior surfaces of the BSC with an appropriate disinfectant. </p>
<p>7.	If the BSC is not scheduled for subsequent use, turn off the fluorescent light and cabinet blower. BSCs are designed for 24 hour operation, but in the interest of energy conservation it should be shut down when it will not be used for an extended period of time. </p>
<p>8.	Turn of the UV light if the cabinet is equipped and if appropriate. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.4: Spills in a Biological Safety Cabinet </h4>
<p>9.	Leave the Biological Safety Cabinet turned on.</p>
<p>10.	During the cleanup of spills, gloves should be changed whenever they become contaminated, after the work surface is decontaminated and before placing a new absorbent liner in the cabinet. Unless working with a double pair of gloves, hands should be washed whenever gloves are changed. </p>

<p>11.	Small Spills that occur while working in the BSC should be handled immediately to avoid subsequent spread of the contaminating material. </p>
<p>1.	Protect the other materials you are working with from possible contamination by closing culture plates, flasks, bottles of media, etc. </p>
<p>2.	If the spill has been absorbed by a liner, carefully fold the liner over on itself so that further contact with spilled material is prevented by the liner’s plastic backing. Otherwise contain the spill with absorbent materials and apply and an appropriate disinfectant. </p>
<p>3.	Any splatter onto items within the cabinet, as well as the cabinet interior, should be immediately cleaned with absorbent paper toweling soaked with disinfectant. </p>
<p>4.	The materials used for cleanup should be put into a biohazard bag or wrapped in a leak-proof liner before removal from the BSC for proper disposal. </p>
<p>5.	After decontamination is complete, allow the BSC to run for 3 to 5 minutes before resuming your work. </p>

<p>6.	Large Spills that result in liquids flowing across the work surface or through the front or rear grills require more extensive decontamination. </p>
<p>1.	Contain the spill with absorbent material </p>
<p>2.	All items within the cabinet should be surface decontaminated and removed from the BSC. </p>
<p>3.	Apply an appropriate decontaminating solution onto the work surface and if necessary through the grill(s) and into the drain pan or lower plenum and allow 20 to 30 minutes contact time for decontamination; this varies with the disinfectant and the infectious agent. Consult the MSDS for the agent and/or the manufacturer’s directions for the disinfectant. </p>
<p>4.	The spilled fluid and disinfectant solution on the work surface should be absorbed with paper towels and discarded into a biohazard bag before removal from the BSC. </p>
<p>5.	If material was spilled though the cabinet’s grills, the work surface must be removed after it is decontaminated to allow access and cleaning of the drain pan or lower plenum. </p>
<p>6.	If the BSC is equipped with a drain valve, the spilled liquid and decontaminating solution may be emptied through a piece of flexible tubing attached to the drain valve and into a collection vessel containing additional disinfectant. The tubing should be of sufficient length to allow the open end to be submerged in the disinfectant within the collection vessel. For BSC’s without a drain valve, the spilled liquid and disinfectant should be absorbed with paper towels and discarded into a biohazard bag. </p>
<p>7.	Should the spilled liquid contain radioactive material, a similar procedure can be followed. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.5: Routine Maintenance of a Biological Safety Cabinet </h4>
<h4>Weekly or as needed </h4>
<p>1.	With the cabinet running verify that the reading on the pressure gauge is within the correct range for safe operation of the BSC. </p>
<p>2.	Disinfect all surfaces inside the cabinet with 70% ethanol or another appropriate disinfectant. To facilitate cleaning a tool similar to the swiffer sweeper may be used to manipulate a disposable towel saturated with 70% ethanol into the less accessible regions of the cabinet. </p>
<p>3.	The glass, front sash of the cabinet may also be cleaned with 70% ethanol or glass cleaner. </p>
<p>4.	If UV light is used in conjunction with chemical disinfectants for the disinfection of interior cabinet surfaces, the light must be cleaned at least weekly with 70% ethanol to ensure that the light’s effectiveness is not diminished by the accumulation of dust or other deposits on its surface. </p>

<h4>Monthly or as needed </h4>
<p>1.	Clean the exterior surfaces of the BSC with a damp cloth or disposable towel. Pay particular attention to remove any accumulated dust on the front and top of the cabinet </p>
<p>2.	Disinfect all surfaces inside the cabinet with 70% ethanol or another appropriate disinfectant. To facilitate cleaning a tool similar to the swiffer sweeper may be used to manipulate a disposable towel saturated with 70% ethanol into the less accessible regions of the cabinet. </p>
<p>3.	Remove the cabinet work surface for access to the lower plenum / drain pan. Dirty drain pan surfaces and grilles, may eventually block the drain valve and/or obstruct airflow in the cabinet. Apply 70% ethanol to the dirty surfaces and wipe them carefully using disposable paper towels. Use caution while wiping these surfaces to avoid injury from broken glass that may be present and sharp metal edges. Never leave toweling on the drain pan because the paper could block the drain valve or the air passages in the cabinet. </p>

<h4>Annually</h4>
<p>Have the biological safety cabinet certified by a qualified technician</p>

<h3>3.8.2: CENTRIFUGES</h3>
<p>1.	Hazards associated with centrifuging include mechanical failure (e.g. rotor failure, tube or bucket failure) and the creation of aerosols. </p>
<p>2.	To minimize the risk of mechanical failure, centrifuges must be maintained and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. </p>
<p>3.	Users must be properly trained, and operating instructions that include safety precautions must be prominently posted on the unit. </p>
<p>4.	The greatest aerosol hazard is created if a tube breaks during centrifugation. </p>
<p>5.	To minimize the generation of aerosols when centrifuging BSL-2 or BSL-3 agents the following procedures are required:</p>
<p>1.	Use sealed tubes, safety cups, or sealed rotors that seal with O-rings. </p>
<p>2.	Before use, inspect tubes, O-rings and buckets for cracks, chips, erosions, bits of broken glass, etc. </p>
<p>3.	Do not use aluminum foil to cap centrifuge tubes because it may detach or rupture during centrifugation.</p>
<p>4.	Open sealed tubes, safety cups, or sealed rotors inside a biosafety cabinet.</p>
<p>5.	Avoid overfilling of centrifuge tubes so that closures do not become wet. </p>
<p>6.	After tubes are filled and sealed, wipe them down with disinfectant.</p>
<p>7.	Do not decant or pour off supernatant of tubes containing biohazardous materials.</p>
<p>8.	Use a vacuum system with appropriate in-line reservoirs and filters.</p>
<p>9.	Work in a biosafety cabinet when re-suspending sedimented material from a biohazardous source. </p>
<p>10.	Use a swirling rotary motion rather than shaking.</p>
<p>11.	If shaking is necessary, wait a few minutes to permit the aerosol to settle before opening the tube.</p>
<p>12.	Small low-speed centrifuges may be placed in a biosafety cabinet during use to reduce the aerosol escape. High-speed centrifuges pose additional hazards. Precautions must be taken to filter the exhaust air from vacuum lines. Manufacturers, recommendations must be meticulously followed to avoid metal fatigue, distortion and corrosion.</p>
<p>13.	Avoid the use of celluloid (cellulose nitrate) tubes with biohazardous materials. Celluloid centrifuge tubes are highly flammable and prone to shrinkage with age. They distort on boiling and can be highly explosive in an autoclave. If celluloid tubes must be used, an appropriate chemical disinfectant must be used to decontaminate them.</p>

<h3>3.8.3: AEROSOL-GENERATING EQUIPMENT</h3>
<p>1.	The use of blenders, ultrasonic disrupters, grinders and lyophilizers can result in considerable aerosol production. </p>
<p>2.	This equipment and any other device that may generate an aerosol must be used in a biosafety cabinet when working at BSL-2 or BSL-3.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.1: Blenders</h4>
<p>1.	Safety blenders are designed to prevent leakage from the bottom of the blender jar, provide a cooling jacket to avoid biological inactivation and to withstand sterilization by autoclaving.</p>
<p>2.	Test blender rotors with sterile saline or dye solution to determine if they are leak-proof prior to use with recombinant and/or biohazardous material. </p>
<p>3.	The use of glass blender jars is not recommended because of the breakage potential. If they must be used, glass jars must be covered with a polypropylene jar to prevent spraying of glass and contents in the event the blender jar breaks. </p>
<p>4.	A towel moistened with disinfectant must be placed over the top of the blender during use. </p>
<p>5.	Before opening the blender jar, allow the unit to rest for at least one minute to allow the aerosol to settle and then open in a BSC. </p>
<p>6.	The device must be decontaminated promptly after use.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.2: Sonicators and French Presses</h4>
<p>1.	Sonication of living microorganisms is potentially a source of aerosols. Whether using sonicating bath or probe sonicator, precautions must be taken to protect personnel.</p>
<p>2.	Ordinarily, this will be done by performing the sonication in a biosafety cabinet or glove box.</p>
<p>3.	It is prudent to consider all surfaces in the vicinity of the sonicator to be contaminated following its use, and they must be thoroughly disinfected.</p>
<p>4.	The use of French pressure cells requires similar caution. </p>
<p>5.	The greatest potential for aerosols is at or near the end of a pressing cycle, when air bubbles at the top of the column of suspension can escape with little or no warning. This can result in microaerosols, which will contaminate the work area, but also in macroaerosols which can effectively inoculate the mucus membranes and conjunctivae of the operator. </p>
<p>6.	Due to the size of the press, it is usually impractical to perform this operation inside a biosafety cabinet. </p>
<p>7.	Thus, one must avoid pressing live organisms which are human pathogens. </p>
<p>8.	Operators must use face shields or other eye protection.</p>
<p>9.	Arcing, which sometimes occurs during electroporation of bacteria, can also cause aerosols. </p>
<p>10.	These range from minimal spattering of the bacteria/DNA solution to major broadcast of potentially infectious material when a cuvette shatters. The shields supplied with most electroporators are usually sufficient to protect the operator from flying plastic and gross contamination, but will not contain microaerosols. </p>
<p>11.	Thus, if one must electroporate bacteria at BSL-2 or 3, it must be done in a biosafety cabinet.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.3: Cell Concentrators</h4>
<p>1.	Cell concentrators are also employed in laboratories as a means of handling viable organisms.</p>
<p>2.	There are two principal types of cell concentrators. </p>
<p>3.	The first involves the removal (through evaporation) of liquid from solid material thereby increasing the concentration versus volume.</p>
<p>4.	The second involves the retention of the solid material on the surface of a filter and the subsequent harvesting of the material from the filter surface. </p>
<p>5.	The following safety rules must be applied when using such an apparatus:</p>
<p>6.	Before starting, check all of the equipment to be used for signs of stress or fatigue. Pay close attention to tubing and glassware</p>
<p>7.	When possible conduct the procedure in a biosafety cabinet.</p>
<p>8.	Upon the completion of the run, thoroughly sanitize the apparatus before the next experiment.</p>
<p>9.	For rotary type concentrators, make sure the load is balanced.</p>
<p>10.	If a vacuum is to be used, make sure the appropriate exhaust filter is present on the vacuum line to prevent contamination (normally a 0.22μm hydrophobic filter).</p>
<p>11.	Do not exceed recommended pressures or speed for operation of equipment.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.4: Lyophilizers and Ampoules</h4>
<p>1.	Depending on lyophilizer design, aerosol production may occur when material is loaded or removed from the lyophilizer unit. </p>
<p>2.	If working at BSL-2 or BSL-3, sample material must be loaded in a biosafety cabinet. </p>
<p>3.	The vacuum pump exhaust must be filtered to remove any hazardous agents or, alternatively, the pump can be vented into a biosafety cabinet. </p>
<p>4.	After lyophilization is completed, all surfaces of the unit that have been exposed to the agent must be disinfected.</p>
<p>5.	If the lyophilizer is equipped with a removable chamber, it must be closed off and moved to a biosafety cabinet for unloading and decontamination. </p>
<p>6.	Handling of cultures must be minimized and vapor traps must be used.</p>
<p>7.	Opening ampoules containing liquid or lyophilized culture material at BSL-2 and BSL-3 must be performed in a biosafety cabinet to control the aerosol produced. </p>
<p>8.	To open, nick the neck of the ampoule with a file. Wrap it in a disinfectant soaked towel. Hold the ampoule upright and snap it open at the nick. </p>
<p>9.	Reconstitute the contents of the ampoule by slowly adding liquid to avoid aerosolization of the dried material. Mix the contents without bubbling and withdraw it into a resh container. </p>
<p>10.	Discard the towel and ampoule top and bottom as biohazardous material waste.</p>
<p>11.	Ampoules used to store biohazardous material in liquid nitrogen have exploded causing eye injuries. </p>
<p>12.	The use of polypropylene tubes eliminates this hazard. These tubes are available dust-free and presterilized, and are fitted with polyethylene caps with silicone washers. </p>
<p>13.	Heat sealable polypropylene tubes are also available.</p>

<h4>3.8.4: PROTECTING VACUUM SYSTEMS</h4>
<p>1.	The aspiration of tissue culture media from cultures and supernatants from centrifuged samples into primary collection flasks is a common laboratory procedure. Protection against pulling biological aerosols or overflow fluid into the vacuum system is necessary.</p>
<p>2.	An overflow flask and a cartridge type filter are required to provide protection for the vacuum line.</p>
<p>3.	For assembling the apparatus, flexible tubing is used of appropriate inside diameter for the flask and filter fittings and of sufficient wall thickness for the applied vacuum. Filter flask of capacities from 250 to 4,000 ml may be used for the overflow flask depending on the amount of fluid that could be aspirated out of the collection flask.</p>
<p>4.	The overflow flask contains a disinfectant solution appropriate for the recombinant and/or biological material in use. Bubbling of air through the disinfectant can cause foam which can shut off the vacuum if it reaches the filter.</p>
<p>5.	Change the filter if it becomes contaminated.</p>

<h2>3.9: DECONTAMINATION:</h2>
<p>1.	Decontamination is a process in which a laboratory worker cleans an area, equipment, device, or material so it is safe to work in/on or handle. </p>
<p>2.	The main purpose of decontaminating is to reduce the level of microbial contamination so that infection transmission is eliminated. </p>
<p>3.	Decontamination process include:  </p>
<p>1.	Hand washing their hands with soap and water.</p>
<p>2.	Autoclaving biohazardous waste.</p>
<p>3.	Liquid chemical germicides disinfectants may be used for decontamination of laboratory surfaces such as bench tops. </p>
<p>4.	The most common disinfectants that are used for decontamination are sodium hypochlorite solutions, oxidative solutions, peracetic acid, phenols, and iodophors. </p>
<p>5.	Disinfectants chosen must be effective against agents that are being used in the laboratory. </p>
<p>6.	Individuals should refer to the agent’s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), if available, to determine the type of disinfectant to use. A source of microbial MSDS is “Material</p>
<p>7.	Concentration and contact time can vary depending on the formulation and the manufacturer’s instructions for use.</p>
<p>8.	SAEC requires laboratories to have a decontamination procedure in place and available in the laboratory prior to work: </p>
<p>1.	A decontamination procedure should describe what disinfectant will be used, the concentration level, and the contact time needed to disinfect. </p>
<p>2.	It should also include the rationale for the disinfecting agent, the approach to its application, and other parameters.</p>

<h2>3.10: STORAGE OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS</h2>
<p>1.	A biological hazard sign must be clearly posted on storage areas such as refrigerators, freezers, cabinets, etc. containing recombinant and/or biohazardous materials.</p>
<p>2.	All containers and/or racks are to be clearly labeled to identify the contents.</p>
<p>3.	Storage containers must be intact (no tears or cracks), leak-proof and covered or closed to avoid spills or contamination. Secondary containment must be used when possible.</p>
<p>4.	To prevent unnecessary handling of specimens, all materials should be inventoried and organized.</p>
<p>5.	Any substance being stored in a freezer must be placed in a labeled container designed for low temperature storage.</p>
<p>6.	If flammable materials are used, they must be stored in equipment that is designed for this purpose.</p>
<p>7.	No personal items must be stored in lab refrigerators, freezers or incubators (e.g. food, beverages).</p>
<p>8.	When storage equipment needs repair, calibration or transport, it must be completely decontaminated prior to starting work or being removed.</p>

<h2>3.11: DISPOSAL OF BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL WASTE </h2>
<p>1.	Each laboratory is responsible for the proper collection and disposal of biological and medical waste. </p>
<p>2.	The regulated materials as well as any items contaminated by contact with these materials should be separated from the regular waste stream and collected in appropriate containers. </p>
<p>3.	Regulated Materials include: </p>
<p>1.	Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biological, including laboratory waste, biological production wastes, discarded live and attenuated vaccines, culture dishes, and related devices. </p>
<p>2.	Liquid human and animal waste, including blood and blood products and body fluids, but not including urine or materials stained with blood or body fluids. </p>
<p>3.	Pathological waste such as human organs, tissues, body parts other than teeth, products of conception, and fluids removed by trauma or during surgery or autopsy or other medical procedure, and not fixed in formaldehyde. </p>
<p>4.	Sharps including needles, syringes, scalpels, and intravenous tubing with needles attached. </p>
<p>5.	Contaminated wastes from research animals that have been exposed to agents infectious to humans. </p>
<p>6.	Proper disposal of these regulated materials is detailed below. </p>

<h3>3.11.1: Solid Waste </h3>
<p>1.	Solid waste including culture plates, flasks and other disposable materials containing or contaminated with regulated waste materials such gloves, or materials used for cleaning/absorbing spills of blood or other biological liquids shall be collected in a durable leak proof container. </p>
<p>2.	This container shall be prominently labeled for biohazardous waste collection and equipped with a lid to minimize exposure to discarded waste material. </p>
<p>3.	A five gallon biohazard disposal bucket available from a variety of vendors is recommended. </p>
<p>4.	The carrying handle and smaller size of the 5 gallon bucket allow for easy and safe transport of biological waste from the laboratory to an autoclave for decontamination. </p>
<p>5.	Containers for collection of solid biological and medical waste should be lined with a clear, autoclavable, polypropylene bag. </p>
<p>6.	Do not collect regulated waste in bags that are printed with the biohazard symbol and/or labeled for biohazardous waste. </p>
<p>7.	Even after decontamination in an autoclave, these bags will not be accepted for final disposal in local sanitary landfills and will consequently require additional expense for disposal. </p>
<p>8.	Do not overfill or compact waste in the container. When the container is approximately 3/4 full, loosely gather the top of the autoclavable liner into the bucket/container and close the lid for safe transport to an autoclave. </p>
<p>9.	At the autoclave, remove the bag from the bucket and place into an autoclavable secondary container. </p>
<p>10.	Add about 250ml of water to the bag. This will facilitate the generation of steam within the bag necessary for decontamination of the waste. Before loading into the autoclave, place a chemical sterilization indicator into the bag so that it is located near the middle of the load, and then loosely secure the top of the bag with autoclave tape. </p>
<p>11.	Do Not seal the bag. For effective sterilization to occur it is critical that air and steam are able to move freely into and out of the bag during the autoclave cycle. </p>
<p>12.	Depending on the size of the autoclave, multiple bags of waste may be decontaminated in a single autoclave run. </p>
<p>13.	However, do not overload the autoclave since decontamination is dependent upon the size of the load. If in doubt a smaller load is better. </p>
<p>14.	Typically, biological waste should be processed for a minimum of 60 minutes.</p>
<p>15.	After autoclaving, remove the chemical indicator from the bag and verify that conditions during the run were adequate for sterilization. </p>
<p>16.	Adequately processed waste may be discarded into the regular waste stream as non-hazardous waste. </p>

<h3>3.11.2: Liquid waste </h3>
<p>1.	Blood and other body fluids may be disposed off without prior disinfection by pouring down the drain of an appropriate laboratory sink and into the sanitary sewer (A sink that is not used for hand-washing is preferred). </p>
<p>2.	Use a sufficient amount of water to rinse all the material into the drain.</p>
<p>3.	Following disposal, decontaminate the surfaces of the sink with an appropriate disinfectant such as a 10% solution of bleach and finally rinse with water to remove any residue. </p>
<p>4.	Other liquid biological wastes generated in the laboratory such as spent culture media must be decontaminated either by chemical treatment or autoclaving prior to being discarded into the sanitary sewer. </p>
<p>1.	Chemical treatment is recommended since it allows for treatment of waste in the laboratory and thereby reduces the potential for spills or exposures during transport to the autoclave. </p>
<p>2.	For chemical decontamination of liquid biological waste using bleach: add household bleach (~5% sodium hypochlorite) to the container of liquid waste so that the final volume of the solution is 10% bleach. Mix gently and allow a minimum of 30 minutes contact time before discarding into the sanitary sewer. Longer contact times may be required for some infectious agents. Contact the Biosafety Officer for additional information.</p>
<p>5.	Do not autoclave liquid wastes that have been treated with bleach. Bleach is very corrosive to the interior surfaces of an autoclave and reduces the useful life span of the autoclave and will void manufacturers’ warranties. </p>
<p>6.	For decontamination of liquid biological waste in the autoclave: </p>
<p>1.	Verify that the container holding the liquid is able to withstand autoclave temperatures and is of adequate size to minimize the potential for boil-over in the autoclave. The container should be filled to no more than about 1/3 of its capacity. </p>
<p>2.	Cover the container loosely with a lid or piece of aluminum foil, place it into an autoclavable secondary container and use a cart to transport the waste to an autoclave. </p>
<p>3.	Autoclaves the liquid biological waste using the liquid cycle/slow exhaust for a minimum of 60 minutes. A chemical indicator such as sterilization monitor should be suspended in the liquid to verify that it has reached sterilization temperatures during the run. </p>
<p>4.	Upon completion of the run, examine the chemical indicator to ensure that decontamination was successful before discarding the solution into the sanitary sewer. </p>

<h3>3.11.3: Pathological Waste </h3>
<p>1.	Human pathological waste as defined by SAEC and similar waste generated from research with animals shall be handled in the same manner. </p>
<p>2.	Items for disposal shall be contained in a sealed plastic bag and clearly labeled as pathological waste. </p>
<p>3.	Pathological waste may be stored temporarily in the laboratory’s refrigerator or freezer until arrangements can be made for proper disposal. </p>

<h3>3.11.4: Sharps </h3>
<p>1.	According to this SAEC Waste Policy, “Sharps means needles, syringes, scalpels, and intravenous tubing with needles attached.” </p>
<p>2.	For purposes of collection and disposal at SAEC, the definition of sharps may be expanded to include glass microscope slides, Pasteur pipettes, microtome blades, capillary tubes and any other items that are contaminated with infectious or potentially infectious biological materials and are capable of causing puncture wounds or lacerations if handled improperly. </p>
<p>3.	This working definition of sharps is not limited to those items that are specifically used in medical or biological procedures and with the exception sharps that are contaminated with hazardous, toxic or radioactive chemicals, includes sharps generated from all other uses. </p>
<p>4.	Guidelines for the disposal of sharps: </p>
<p>1.	Never discard needles or other disposable sharp instruments into the regular trash or into bags containing hazardous waste. </p>
<p>2.	Immediately discard all used sharps directly into puncture-resistant containers that are specifically designed / designated for the collection of sharps. </p>
<p>3.	Medical waste regulations require that containers holding discarded needles, syringes and/or scalpels are disposed of within 90 days of initial use. Selection of container size should be based upon the anticipated volume of sharps that will be generated during a 90 day period. Containers for sharps disposal can be purchased from a variety of vendors. </p>
<p>4.	Sharps containers used for the collection of needles, syringes and/or scalpels shall be dated when they are put into use and shall not be kept in the laboratory beyond 90 days from their initial use. </p>
<p>5.	Pasteur pipettes and other disposable glass items that are not contaminated with potentially infectious materials may be discarded into broken glass containers. </p>
<p>6.	Disposable syringes with needles shall be discarded as a unit. If the needle must be removed, use the integrated device for needle removal found on most sharps containers or use other mechanical means. </p>
<p>7.	Used needles and other contaminated sharps shall not be bent, broken, cut, recapped, re-sheathed or otherwise manipulated by hand. If any of the actions described above are required by a specific procedure, they will be done using a mechanical device such as pliers or hemostats. </p>
<p>8.	Do not over-fill sharps containers. They should be closed and sealed when they are approximately 3/4 full. </p>
<p>9.	If the outside of a filled sharps container is contaminated, the surface of the container should be chemically disinfected or the container autoclaved prior to being removed from the laboratory. </p>
<p>10.	Sharps containers used for the collection of discarded needles, syringes and scalpels cannot be put into the trash. Even after decontamination, these sharps are considered as regulated medical waste and must be disposed of in accordance with regulations. </p>
<p>11.	The final disposal of sharps containers is coordinated by SAEC. Filled sharps containers will be collected at a central location within the department/building. Pick-up for final disposal will be on a quarterly basis to coincide with the state mandated 90 day limit for the storage of used sharps. </p>

<h2>3.12: TRANSPORTING OF BIOLIOGICAL MATERIALS</h2>
<p>1.	Any time recombinant and/or biohazardous material or a toxin solution including biohazardous waste is moved outside the lab, into public space or into a high traffic area (such as within an open bay) it must be transported in a closed, rigid secondary container.</p>
<p>2.	Rigid secondary containers are containers such as pails, cartons, drums, dumpsters or bins for storage.</p>
<p>3.	Secondary containers must be leak-proof and have tight-fitting covers.</p>
<p>4.	Secondary containers must be labeled as biohazardous or recombinant.</p>
<p>5.	The outside of the secondary container must be decontaminated before leaving the lab.</p>
<p>6.	Reusable secondary containers must be easy to clean and must be washed and decontaminated each time they are emptied, unless they have been completely protected from contamination</p>
<p>7.	Toxins must be in leak proof secondary container if not inside a biosafety cabinet.</p>
<p>8.	Recombinant and biohazardous material must not be transported in a personal vehicle for any reason. However, use of a university or university sponsored vehicle is permitted.</p>

<h2>3.13: SHIPPING OF BIOLIOGICAL MATERIALS</h2>
<p>1.	Shipping regulations categorize biological materials in the following manner:</p>
<p>2.	Unregulated biological material;</p>
<p>3.	Infectious substances (Category A infectious substances);</p>
<p>4.	Diagnostic specimens (Category B infectious substances);</p>
<p>5.	Biological products; or</p>
<p>6.	Genetically modified organisms and microorganisms.</p>
<p>7.	SAEC’ Shipping regulations comply with:</p>
<p>8.	Sudan National Civil Aviation Organization (not yet developed).</p>
<p>9.	Sudan Federal Ministry of Health (not yet developed).</p>
<p>10.	International Air Transport Association (IATA)</p>
<p>11.	International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)</p>
<p>12.	Training:</p>
<p>1.	All individuals that ship recombinant and/or biohazardous materials must receive training on Biosafety Principles from or IATA/ICAO or any other affiliated organization.</p>
<p>14.	Permits:</p>
<p>15.	Sudan Customs officials require import permits to accompany all shipments of infectious substances, animals, animal-derived materials, insects, etiologic agents, biological toxins, or genetically modified organisms that enter the country or cross the borders. </p>
<p>16.	Regulations that govern the transfer of biological materials help to minimize or eliminate the possible threats to public health and agriculture. </p>
<p>17.	The receiver is often best suited to obtain import permits upon request by the shipper. </p>
<p>18.	The shipper is responsible for obtaining export permits. International shipments must not be made until these permits have been granted by the proper national authority.</p>

<h2>3.14: ANIMAL HANDLING </h2>
<p>1.	All employees who work with live animals are required to complete the IBC Placement Health Review for Animal Handlers. </p>

<h3>3.14.1: Personnel Training: </h3>
<p>1.	Animal Handlers should have Training Sessions on animal care and use.</p>
<p>2.	Required sessions are available online. These trainings provide detailed instruction on both regulatory compliance and basic husbandry. </p>
<p>3.	Husbandry (DLAR website): </p>
<p>1.	Animals shall be provided nutritionally adequate food, potable, non-contaminated water and a sanitary environment in which the animal’s health shall not be affected. </p>
<p>5.	Injections: </p>
<p>1.	All sharps shall be disposed of immediately after use in an approved sharps container. Needles shall not be broken, bent, or recapped before disposal. A one-handed recapping procedure may be incorporated only after approval by the BSO. Physical restraint procedures should be developed and practiced to prevent accidental autoinoculation while at the same time reducing stress on the animal. </p>

<p>38.	Animal Restraint: </p>
<p>39.	Proper restraint and handling techniques are essential for reducing stress to laboratory animals, while at the same time allow animal care workers to perform their work with less chance of being scratched, bitten, kicked, etc. Animals can be restrained either manually or with restraint devices. It is the responsibility of the PI to train their staff on proper restraint for each species used. </p>
<p>40.	Changing Bedding: </p>
<p>41.	Precautions should be taken, while changing animal bedding, to minimize or eliminate the aerosolization of hazardous agents which may have been shed by the animal. </p>
<p>42.	The use of a biological safety cabinet (BSC) or chemical fume hood should be used when changing animals dosed with hazardous agents. </p>
<p>43.	Many allergens can also be aerosolized during bedding changing. Some options include the use of a cage changing station, or decontaminating the soiled bedding before disposal by placing the whole cage in a biohazard bag and then autoclaving it. </p>
<p>44.	Cage changing stations are not appropriate for animals dosed with biohazardous material and autoclaving may not be appropriate for those dosed with chemical toxins. </p>

<p>45.	Allergens: </p>
<p>46.	Laboratory animal allergies and associated asthma are among the most common conditions affecting individuals who work with laboratory animals. </p>
<p>47.	Typically, allergies to animals result from repeated exposure to an animal’s dander, urine, saliva, serum, or other body tissues. Symptoms can range from mild (e.g. itchy or runny nose and eyes) to severe (e.g. shortness of breath or red, itchy wheals on skin). </p>
<p>48.	Levels of airborne allergens tend to rise significantly with certain activities such as changing or cleaning animal cages. To reduce the levels of airborne allergens, SAEC-BSI recommends using: </p>
<p>49.	Ventilated hoods (cage changing station, biological safety cabinet (BSC), or chemical fume hood) for cage changing </p>
<p>50.	Dust-free bedding, or </p>
<p>51.	Filtered caging systems. </p>
<p>52.	If these options aren’t available or feasible for a particular situation, then personal respiratory protection may be required. </p>
<p>53.	Contact BSO for more information about respirators. </p>
<p>54.	Contact BSO if you have allergy concerns. </p>

<h3>55.	Carcass Disposal: </h3>
<p>56.	All non-radioactive animal carcasses are to be collected incinerated. </p>
<p>57.	Radioactive carcasses and their associated lab waste (i.e. bedding, excreta, sharps, etc.) </p>
<p>58.	Should be bagged and sealed in 3 mil plastic bags. </p>
<p>59.	Make sure that all sharps are contained in a puncture resistant container before placing in plastic bags. </p>
<p>60.	Once properly labeled, the bags are refrigerated in a lined 30 gallon plastic drum. </p>

<h3>61.	Safe Use of Anesthetic Gases: </h3>
<p>62.	Many anesthetic gases are used at SAEC for performing animal surgeries.</p>
<p>63.	These gases can present a risk for potential exposure to the lab personnel performing the surgeries. </p>
<p>64.	Anesthetics of concern include ether, nitrous oxide, and halogenated agents (e.g. halothane, isoflurane, methoxyflurane). </p>
<p>65.	Some of these halogenated anesthetics have been linked to adverse health effects in exposed workers, such as reproductive and neurological effects.</p>
<p>66.	Emphasis must be placed on protecting personnel from exposure by adequately “capturing” the waste gas being generated. </p>
<p>67.	This may be accomplished by several methods depending on the method of delivery of the gas: </p>
<p>68.	For enclosed chambers (e.g. Bell jar): </p>
<p>69.	Perform work in a fume hood so when lid is removed, gases are captured by hood. </p>
<p>70.	Evacuate chamber via building vacuum system prior to removing lid.</p>
<p>71.	Make sure the chamber lid is tight-fitting. </p>
<p>72.	Remove chamber lid only when animal is being placed into or removed. </p>

<h3>73.	For anesthetic gas machines and vaporizers: </h3>
<p>74.	Verify that proper filtration canisters are installed. </p>
<p>75.	Maintain filter canisters according to manufacturer’s specifications. </p>
<p>76.	Choose an appropriate sized face-piece to ensure most efficient waste gas recovery. </p>
<p>77.	Maintain anesthesia machines and vaporizers according to manufacturer’s instructions and in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Program’s Policy on General Inhalational Anesthesia Machine/Vaporizer/Waste Gas Maintenance and Calibration. </p>
<p>78.	Lab personnel who are concerned with possible exposure to anesthetic gases may contact BSO to request an exposure risk evaluation.</p>

<h2>3.15: SELECT AGENTS AND TOXINS AND BIOTERRORISM </h2>
<p>1.	As a core value and moral precept of Sudanese People not to prejudice Human Integrity anywhere, SAEC and The Government of Sudan buildup and follow extremely strict, transparent and internationally cooperative policy in regard with Select Agents and Toxins and Bioterrorism. </p>
<p>2.	Globally, United States Government represented in The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and The Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) requires institutions that possess, use, or transfer certain biological agents and toxins (known as “select agents”) to be registered and approved. Listed in Appendix D.</p>
<p>3.	These select agents have been have identified as specific biological agents and toxins considered to be a severe threat to public health and safety because of their potential use as bioterrorism agents.</p>

<h3>3.15.1: Procedure: </h3>
<p>1.	SAEC institutions do not deal or handle and do not allow dealing and handling any of select agent or toxin.</p>
<p>2.	In case of one of the principal investigator has to deal or handle a select agent or toxin, following procedure should be followed:</p>

<h3>3.	Responsible Official:</h3>
<p>1.	Select agent regulations require that a Responsible Official (RO) be designated for each institution that possesses and uses select agents. </p>
<p>2.	SAEC’s RO is represented by BSO.</p>
<p>3.	RO has institutional responsibility for the biosafety, security, and regulatory compliance of select agents, and as such, must be contacted prior to obtaining any select agents.</p>
<p>4.	Authorization to Possess and Use Select Agents</p>
<p>5.	Prior to personnel obtaining any select agent, the IBC must review and approve any proposed work. </p>
<p>6.	In addition, PIs who want to acquire, possess, or use any biological agent or toxin listed as a select agent must be registered and approved with the appropriate national agency (such as Sudan National Biosefty Authority or Federal Ministry of Health) prior to obtaining the agent(s) or toxin(s).</p>
<p>7.	The appropriate agency must approve both the institution and the individual laboratory. </p>
<p>8.	Investigators who want to possess and use select agents must contact the RO for assistance with the registration process. </p>
<p>9.	Approval can take several months, and PIs should plan research projects accordingly.</p>
<p>10.	The select agent regulations contain very strict requirements regarding biosafety, training, emergency response, security and accountability, as well as other requirements. </p>
<p>11.	Investigators wanting to acquire select agents should thoroughly review the National (not yet developed) and International (such as SSH or USAD) select agent regulations (whichever is appropriate) before initiating the registration application process.</p>

		<h1> SECTION THREE:   </h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
		<center><h1>BASIS FOR RADIATION PROTECTION POLICES <h1></center>
<p>Ionizing radiation is capable of producing biological effects that are detrimental to health. It is assumed that any radiation dose, no matter how small, could produce some effect. The purpose of a radiation safety program is to prevent unnecessary radiation exposures, and to control those that are necessary. Each person who is knowingly exposed to ionizing radiation from sources controlled by SAEC shall be informed of the risks and of appropriate protection methods, and shall accept personal responsibility for using the available protection.</p>

<h2>3.1: Radiation-Induced Health Effects</h2>
<p>Health effects from exposure to ionizing radiation may be stochastic (random in an exposed population) or deterministic (predictable for an individual). </p>
<p>-	Deterministic effects may be observed in an exposed individual when a large radiation dose, exceeding a threshold value, is received in a rather short time. A dose smaller than the threshold value will not produce the effect. If threshold dose for a particular effect is exceeded, the effect is almost sure to occur, but the severity of the effect is proportional to the dose. </p>
<p>-	Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly in an exposed population, usually after a long latent period. Since these effects cannot be distinguished from those that occur in an unexposed population, the cause-and-effect relationship cannot be established on an individual basis, but only on a statistical basis. For these effects it is assumed that there is no threshold dose and that the probability of occurrence is proportional to the dose. However, the severity of the effect, if it occurs, is independent of the dose.</p>

<h2>3.2: Principles of Radiation Protection</h2>
<p>Two basic principles apply to every individual that may be exposed to radiation: </p>
<p>1.	All radiation doses are to be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The ALARA principle is applicable even when the potential dose is well below the individual dose limit because it is assumed that some risk may be associated with any dose of radiation, no matter how small. ALARA also means balancing the benefits of dose reduction against social needs and economic considerations. </p>
<p>2.	No dose to an individual shall be allowed to exceed the appropriate individual dose limit. Dose limits are intended to limit the individual's lifetime risk of stochastic effects from small chronic exposures as well as to prevent non-stochastic effects from large doses. For individuals who are exposed to ionizing radiation as a direct result of their employment, individual dose limits are based on the philosophy that their total health risks should be no greater than the risks accepted by workers in comparable occupations or industries who are not exposed to radiation. For anyone who does not receive a direct benefit, e.g. a salary, related to their radiation exposure, the individual dose limits are much smaller than those for radiation users. These "non-occupational" limits are based on comparisons with the ordinary risks of living, rather than on risks due to employment.</p>

<h2>3.3: Radiation Dose - Quantity and Units</h2>
<p>Radiation dose limits are specified as a quantity called the effective dose equivalent in units of rems. The effective dose equivalent is the dose to the whole body from penetrating x rays that would impart the same lifetime risk of detrimental health effects as the sum of the actual doses to all tissues and organs of the body from all types of ionizing radiation. (See the Glossary for a more detailed, technical discussion of this quantity and the included adjustment factors.) SAEC expresses all doses and limits in millirems (1 mrem = 0.001 rem). Throughout the rest of this Manual, unless otherwise clearly specified, "dose" means "effective dose equivalent".</p>

<h2>3.4: Radiation Doses and Risks</h2>
<p>The doses and related health risks produced by nonoccupational radiation exposures may be helpful for understanding the risks from occupational doses. The effective dose from radon in homes is 200 mrem, medical examinations contribute an average of 53 mrem and consumer products and other manmade sources deliver another 9 mrem, for a total of approximately 360 mrem per year. A continuous dose rate of 400mrem per year for 70 years is estimated to contribute approximately 1.5% to the baseline risk of fatal cancer. The majority of radiation users receive occupational doses of much less than 400mrem per year. An additional dose of 400mrem per year for 20 years would increase the baseline risk for fatal cancer by 0.3%.</p>

<h2>3.5: Individual Dose Limits</h2>
<p>The primary occupational dose limit is 5,000 millirems per year, effective dose equivalent. The dose limit for mem bers of the general public, including all persons who are not classified as radiation users, is 100 millirems per year. No person shall be classified as a radiation user simply to justify a higher dose limit. The embryo-fetus may be more susceptible to radiation effects than an adult and is, therefore, subject to a lower dose limit. The dose limit for the embryo-fetus is 500 millirem s during the entire gestation period. As a further precaution, it is advisable to keep the monthly doses below 50 millirems. This degree of protection for the embryo-fetus can only be achieved with the cooperation of the employee, who should notify her supervisor as soon as the pregnancy is known. The limit is enforceable only if the pregnant employee gives written notice to her supervisor, who shall also notify the RSO.</p>

<h2>3.6: ALARA Policy</h2>
<p>SAEC is committed to an effective radiation protection program to eliminate unnecessary exposures to radiation and to reduce all exposures to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), taking into account all social and economic considerations. The ALARA principle is implemented by a comprehensive radiation protection program that includes specific requirements and procedures for:</p>
<p>1.	Training of all radiation users,</p>
<p>2.	Safety evaluations of proposed facilities or projects utilizing radiation in any way,</p>
<p>3.	Regular surveys of work areas for contamination and exposure rates,</p>
<p>4.	Monitoring of radiation exposures to groups and individuals,</p>
<p>5.	Investigations of all exposures that exceed predetermined levels, and</p>
<p>6.	audits of the program by the Radiation Safety Committee and/or other qualified experts.</p>
<p>Each facility or program utilizing radiation machines or radioactive materials shall be justified on its merits and shall be specifically authorized by the Radiation Safety Committee. The review and evaluation by the Committee covers the training and experience of individuals authorized to use radiation sources, the adequacy of facilities and equipment, and procedures for the safe use of radiation sources. Specific rules and procedures may be issued by the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) in support of the ALARA concept as well as to assure compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. The RSO and supporting staff provide training, consultation and other services to radiation users to assist them in controlling radiation sources and reducing exposures.</p>

		<center><h1>ACQUISITION OF RADIATION SOURCES <h1></center>
<h2>4.1: Radioactive Materials</h2>
<p>Radioactive materials may be used for any legitimate educational, clinical or research purpose. However, they may be purchased, or otherwise obtained, only by individuals specifically authorized by the Radiation Safety Committee. The use of radioactive materials is conditional upon compliance with specific procedures established by the Committee. Each application for use of any source of ionizing radiation is first reviewed by the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) to assure that it is complete. If the application is for possession of a generally licensed category of radioactive material, it may be approved by the RSO without review by the RSC. All other applications shall be submitted to the User Authorization Subcommittee of  the RSC for evaluation and approval. If the subcommittee does not vote unanimously for approval, the application shall be referred to the main committee (RSC) for resolution. The RSO shall notify the applicant promptly of the action taken by the RSC. Amendments to existing authorizations are normally approved by the RSO if, in the judgement of the RSO, the amended use is within the intent of the initial authorization. If the requested amendment is for a completely different category of use, i.e. if it requires substantially different training, experience or facilities than those required for the initially approved use, the request shall be referred to the RSC. Each user of radioactive materials shall maintain a complete record of all acquisitions, uses, transfers and disposals of such materials and provide these data to the RSO in a timely manner. The receipt of any radioactive material, regardless of the manner in which it is obtained, must be reported promptly to the RSO on a form provided for that purpose. Before any radioactive materials may be transferred to another responsible user, or to another organization, authorization must be obtained from the RSO.</p>

			<center><h1>RADIATION SAFETY PROCEDURE PROTOCOL <h1></center>
<h2>5.1: Radiation safety training</h2>
<p>Regulations governing the possession and use of radioactive materials and other radiation sources require that every individual working with or in the presence of such sources be instructed in the applicable provisions of regulations and license conditions, in the potential health problems associated with exposure to radiation, in the precautions and procedures required for safe use of radiation, and in the proper use of protective and measurement devices. The extent of the training is to be commensurate with the potential risk of radiation exposure to the individual. The primary responsibility for providing adequate training for individuals who work routinely with radiation sources rests with the responsible user. For individuals who are only occasionally exposed to radiation, e.g. most nurses, housekeeping, maintenance, security and delivery personnel, the responsibility for training lies with their supervisors. Generally, the responsible user or supervisor will fulfill this responsibility by assuring that each person attends the appropriate training program offered by the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO). The supervisor or responsible user may also provide the training and submit a statement to the RSO listing the individuals trained and the content of the training. "Normally exposed" and "potentially exposed" radiation users are required to have more extensive training than are "minimally exposed" users. Because of the ongoing experience acquired by individuals working regularly with radiation sources, retraining is not always required. Periodic retraining may be required: </p>
<p>(1) if regulations, license conditions or procedures change, </p>
<p>(2) if contamination or exposure problems occur, or </p>
<p>(3) if procedures are not being followed. </p>
<p>Records of training for "normally" and "potentially exposed" radiation users are kept individually with their dosimetry records. Since many "minimally exposed" users are only infrequently or intermittently exposed, and may not benefit from regular experience with radiation protection, retraining on a regular schedule is generally required. Records of training attendance for these users are maintained on a group basis, since most "minimally exposed" users do not have individual dosimetry records. The RSO is responsible for developing, conducting and documenting appropriate training on radiation protection for all categories of radiation users. For each category, the RSO shall establish an appropriate frequency and minimal requirements for the content of the training program. The RSO shall maintain appropriate records of training offered and completed to assure compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>

<h2>5.2: Control and monitoring of exposure to external radiation sources</h2>
<p>Sources that emit penetrating radiations (gamma and x rays, energetic beta particles, neutrons, etc.) can cause radiation exposures from outside the body. These external exposures shall be controlled by appropriate shielding and by limiting the time spent in close proximity to the source.</p>

<h3>5.2.1: Safety Evaluations</h3>
<p>X-ray machines, particle accelerators and other fixed radiation sources shall be surveyed at least annually to verify adequacy of shielding, alarms, interlocks, and other safety-related apparatus or equipment. During the safety survey, the potential exposure rates to operators are evaluated to assure that they are ALARA and that operators are monitored appropriately.</p>

<h3>5.2.2: Medical X-ray Units</h3>
<p>Personnel who are required to attend patients undergoing various radiological procedures are to be protected from radiation exposure to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with providing safe, competent care of the patient. During medical x-ray procedures, patients should be immobilized without being held, if at all possible. Never allow any part of the body of anyone but the patient to be in the primary x-ray beam. During medical fluoroscopic procedures, the primary source of exposure to attending personnel is radiation scattered from the patient. Since radiation intensity decreases rapidly with distance from the source, it is advisable to step back from the patient whenever possible. Even a little shielding is very effective against the lowenergy radiation scattered from the patient. If you must stay near the patient, wear a lead apron.</p>

<h3>5.2.3: Radioactive Materials</h3>
Radionuclide sources that emit penetrating radiations should be stored and handled within appropriate shielding whenever physically possible. For gamma and x rays, high-density materials, e.g. lead, provide the most effective shielding. For energetic beta-particle emitters low-atomic-number materials, e.g. plastics, should be used as the primary shielding to minimize bremsstrahlung production. Radioactive materials should be stored in designated containers and locations when not in actual use. The intensity of radiation exposure decreases rapidly with distance from the source. Radionuclide sources that emit penetrating radiations should be stored away from regular work areas; they should be handled, when necessary, with tongs or forceps to eliminate direct contact and to increase the distance from the source.

<h3>5.2.4: Exposure Evaluation and Monitoring</h3>
External exposures are readily detectable with portable instruments and personal monitoring devices (dosimeters). Radioisotope work and storage areas should be surveyed for external exposure rates whenever changes are made in the quantities, locations or shielding of radiation sources. The results of such surveys shall be provided to all individuals working in the area to help them to control their own exposures. Potential radiation exposures from any source, or within any facility, are evaluated by the RSO to determine protection and monitoring requirements. In most cases, exposures are evaluated for groups of individuals engaged in similar activities and exposed to comparable sources. In other situations, monitoring of individual exposures may be necessary.

<h3>5.2.5: Personal Dosimeters (Badges)</h3>
<p>A radiation dosimeter does not provide protection; it merely verifies, after the fact, the adequacy of the radiation control program. Also, radiation dosimetry data are not, of themselves, appropriate to determine risk to any individual; however, they can sometimes help an individual to develop safe work habits. The primary purposes for performing individual monitoring are:</p>
<p>1.	To monitor the individual's radiation environment and to evaluate the adequacy of the radiation control program,</p>
<p>2.	To promote safe radiation working habits by individuals,</p>
<p>3.	To document radiation accidents,</p>
<p>4.	To satisfy medical and legal requirements as are necessary to protect the employee and the employer, and</p>
<p>5.	To comply with pertinent local and international regulations.</p>
<p>Based on the location and nature of the anticipated radiation use, the IBC shall determine if an individual dosimeter is needed; if so, it will be issued in about two weeks. Radiation users who are "minimally exposed" to penetrating radiation from external sources, i.e. those who are unlikely to receive more than one-tenth (10%) of any external occupational dose limit, are not required to wear personal dosimeters. All radiation users who are "normally exposed" or "potentially exposed" to external sources of penetrating radiation are required to wear one or more personal dosimeters. Users subject to general whole-body exposures are issued "body badges", which are to be worn on the front of the torso at all times while working with radiation sources, or on the collar if a lead-impregnated apron is worn. Individuals who routinely wear lead-impregnated aprons may be issued a second badge to be worn on the front of the abdomen under the apron. The purpose of the second badge is to provide additional information for estimating the effective dose equivalent; for females, it also monitors the potential dose to the embryo-fetus in the event of pregnancy. Extremity dosimeters (ring badges) are required when significant quantities of radioisotopes that emit penetrating radiations must be routinely handled directly, or when the hands or fingers could be exposed accidentally to a high intensity source such as an x-ray diffraction unit. Rings badges are available in small, medium and large sizes; if a ring doesn't fit, please request a different size! The ring badge shall be worn inside a glove with the label facing the radiation source, i.e. toward the palm of the hand with the highest potential exposure. Check the badge for contamination as part of each routine survey for personal contamination. Individuals who have been issued one or more dosimeters for any reason are required to wear them at all times when they are working in the presence of any radiation source. When not being worn, dosimeters shall be stored away from heat and radiation sources but they should not be taken home or worn away from work. All dosimeters shall be returned promptly at the end of the monitoring period. Dosimeters not returned by the 5th of the month after they were worn, but within the next 30 days, are considered to be late. Dosimeters returned more than 30 days late, or damaged or misused in any way that invalidates the reading, are considered to be lost.</p>

<h3>5.2.6: Investigation Levels</h3>
<p>The IRC shall establish investigation levels, i.e. levels of radiation dose received during a monitoring period, for each category of "normally exposed" radiation users. Whenever the dose recorded by a dosimeter exceeds the investigation level, the RSO shall cause an investigation to be made to determine the cause of the dose and steps that might be taken to prevent recurrence.</p>

<h2>5.3: control and monitoring of intake of radioisotopes</h2>
<p>It is the responsibility of each radiation user to be thoroughly familiar with the SAEC's Biosafety Policy Manual and the Radiation Procedures and Records (RPR's) applicable to his or her work, to follow safe work practices, to be aware of actual or potential radiation exposures, and to keep all exposures to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Each person who handles unsealed or dispersible radioisotopes is responsible for the control and containment of radioactivity and for performing regular surveys of personnel, personal effects, equipments and work areas using methods that will assure the detection of contamination before significant exposures occurs. The responsible user must assure that the necessary monitoring is performed, recorded and reported. Routine evaluations of all radioisotope laboratories, including surveys for contamination, are also performed by the IBC. In research facilities, application of the ALARA principle dictates that no removable contamination shall be tolerated indefinitely. Whenever contamination is detected, it shall be removed promptly to prevent its spread and the possible exposure of other individuals. Each person who works with potentially dispersible radioactive materials is responsible for:</p>
<p>1.	Knowing the basic properties of the radioactive materials used, e.g. the half-lives of the nuclides, the types of radiation emitted, the annual limit on intake (ALI), and any shielding that may be required;</p>
<p>2.	Being aware of actual or potential radiation exposures and keeping all exposures to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA);</p>
<p>3.	Following safe work practices and the instructions or procedures provided by the responsible user and the IBC;</p>
<p>4.	The control and containment of radioactivity and for performing regular surveys of personnel, personal effects, equipment and work areas using methods that will assure the detection of contamination before significant exposures occur;</p>
<p>5.	Providing and/or analyzing urine samples, obtaining thyroid counts, or wearing personal dosimeters as specified by the IBC; and</p>
<p>6.	Recording the results of all radiation surveys and screening bioassays promptly, completely and accurately. The responsible user shall ensure that the necessary monitoring is performed, recorded and reported. Routine evaluations of all radioisotope laboratories, including surveys for contamination, are also performed by the IBC.</p>

<h3>5.3.1: Handling Precautions</h3>
<p>Ingestion of radioactivity shall be prevented by avoiding mouth contact with any items handled in a radioisotope laboratory (pipettes, pencils, etc.), by prohibiting eating, drinking and smoking in radioisotope handling areas and by careful attention to personal hygiene. Appropriate protective apparel, including lab coats, gloves and closed toe shoes, shall be worn whenever potentially dispersible radioisotopes are being used to prevent contamination of skin and personal clothing. Lab coats and gloves that have been worn in radioisotope handling areas shall not be worn to public area such as the cafeteria, library, etc.</p>

<h3>Contamination Surveys </h3>
<p>Surveys for contamination on the hands and clothing shall be performed immediately after working with significant quantities of radioisotopes to assure detection and removal before any radioactive material enters the body. Any radioactive material on the skin shall be removed promptly by normal washing. If it cannot be removed easily, the IBC should be contacted to assist with decontamination. </p>

<h3>5.3.2: Airborne Activity</h3>
<p>The risk of inhalation of radioactive materials is greatly reduced by performing all operations that release or generate gases, vapors or dusts in approved fume hoods. Emergency response personnel may be required to wear filtered or supplied-air respirators to prevent inhalation of contaminants. Whenever the probability of airborne contamination is significant, the RSO should be notified and air sampling may be required.</p>

<h3>5.3.3: Bioassays</h3>
<p>Although the emphasis of radiation protection is on prevention of exposures, measurement and evaluation of exposures is also necessary. Bioassay is the determination of the kind and amount, and sometimes the location, of radioactive material in the human body by direct measurement in vivo or by analysis in vitro of materials excreted or removed from the body. Bioassay is an important tool for evaluating actual or suspected internal contamination with radioactive materials. Monitoring and dose assessment is required for any individual who is likely to an intake in one year of onetenth (10%) of the annual limit on intake (ALI) of all nuclides combined. To assure that this requirement is met in all cases, individual intakes of smaller quantities shall be detected and evaluated. Individuals who handle dispersible radioiodine compounds may be required to obtain in vivo measurements by the IBS of radioiodine in the thyroid. Individuals who handle other radioisotopes in dispersible form may be required to perform assays of radioactivity in urine on a routine basis to verify the absence of radioactivity in the body or to determine the magnitude of any exposure. Other types of assays may be utilized if, in the judgment of the IBC, such assays will meet the intent of this policy more effectively. A bioassay is required whenever personal contamination or injury caused by a contaminated object occurs, or if airborne radioactivity may have been inhaled. Routine bioassays, at intervals specified for the nuclides used, are required from each user who handles more than minimal quantities of potentially dispersible radionuclides. A routine bioassay may be waived by the RSO when appropriate surveys for contamination, conducted during and after each use of radioactive material according to recommended procedures, demonstrate that there was essentially no exposure to unconfined, dispersible radioactive material.</p>

<h3>5.3.4: Thyroid Protection</h3>
<p>Regular contamination surveys and thyroid monitoring have proven to be effective in preventing unnecessary exposures to radioiodine. Routine thyroid measurements are capable of detecting approximately 10 nCi in the thyroid and verification measurements are required at thyroid burdens of 20-70 nCi, depending on the time since the last measurement. Potassium iodide (KI) is effective for blocking the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid if taken at about the same time, or shortly before, the intake. However, KI is not totally risk free and shall not be used for routine protection. The risk of a serious adverse reaction from a dose of KI is approximately the same as the health risk from a small intake of radioiodine that would be detected by routine thyroid counting. Users should rely on careful handling techniques to prevent unnecessary exposures to radioiodine. Under the normal conditions of contamination control and monitoring required in radioisotope laboratories, the risk of radiation exposure is not sufficient to justify any additional risk from KI ingestion.</p>

<h2>5.4: Personal exposure investigations and reporting:</h2>
<p>SAEC is committed to maintaining all radiation doses to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). One method for accomplishing the ALARA goal is to investigate situations and incidents that lead to unusual exposures, even if no regulatory limit is exceeded. To assure that unexpected radiation exposures are evaluated, investigation levels are established well below the dose limits. For external exposures, the investigation level (IL) is based on the expected (normal) exposure for a category or specific group of radiation users. Values of the IL for doses to the body or to the extremities for various groups are listed in the table on the following page. For internal exposures, the IL is 0.05 ALI per single intake or per calendar quarter. Annual intakes exceeding 0.1 ALI for all nuclides combined shall be included in the calculation of total effective dose equivalent for purposes of determining compliance with annual dose limits and reporting requirements. Potential intakes due to personal contamination or injury involving radioactive materials shall be investigated regardless of the actual radiation dose. Any radiation dose to an individual that exceeds the annual dose limit shall be investigated and reported to the regulatory agency. If the dose is received as the result of a single event, it shall be reported either immediately or within 24 hours, depending on the magnitude of the dose. The IBC directs the investigation, evaluates the results and submits the report to the regulatory agency. The exposed individual shall provide information regarding the circumstances of the exposure. The responsible user shall be informed of the exposure and of any subsequent restrictions that may need to be imposed on the individual.</p>

<h2>5.5: Laboratory evaluation, survey and auditing</h2>
<p>The IBC shall ensure that all areas where radioactive materials are stored or handled are inspected at appropriate intervals to ascertain the radiological risks and to evaluate the control measures in use. Radiation surveys shall be performed, when necessary, by technically qualified personnel using instruments appropriate to the nature of the radioactive materials to be detected or radiation exposures to be measured. For radioisotope laboratories, i.e. those where dispersible radioisotopes are used, the frequency of routine evaluations is based on the "interval inventory", as defined in the Radiation Safety Policy Manual. The "interval inventory" is the total quantity of radioisotopes introduced into the laboratory in a month, averaged over the most restrictive bioassay interval, expressed in ALIs. The routine evaluation frequencies for various average monthly inventories are shown in the box below. If no work with radioisotopes is being done, and all radioisotopes are stored in a locked location conspicuously labeled with a sign that requires notification of the RSO prior to any further use of radioisotopes, the laboratory may be considered to be inactive. An inactive laboratory need not be surveyed routinely, but the status shall be verified at least annually. The nominal survey frequencies given in the box are to be interpreted as guidelines. In cases where continuing contamination problems are found, the interval between surveys will be shortened. If survey results obtained over a period of a year indicate no contamination or exposure problems, the routine survey interval may be increased. In no case, however, will the interval be more than double the nominal interval. To assure a realistic and independent evaluation of typical conditions, the schedule for surveys may be varied randomly.</p>

<h2>5.6: Sealed source leak tests</h2>
<p>Sealed sources of radioactive material shall be tested for leakage at regular intervals to verify the integrity of the source containment and, in the unlikely event of failure, to detect the escape of radioactive material before serious contamination of facilities, equipment or personnel occurs. The frequency of leak tests, and the sensitivity of detection of escaping radioactivity, shall comply with the regulations or license conditions specified by the agency authorizing the possession of the source. Leak tests shall be performed only by qualified individuals using procedures approved by the Radiation Safety Officer. Records of sealed source leak tests shall be maintained by the IBC.</p>

<h2>5.7: Calibration of instruments</h2>
<p>All portable radiation survey instruments used for measuring exposure rates or determining the quantities of radioactivity present in samples or on surfaces (as contamination) are to be calibrated at least once a year. Calibrations are to be performed by individuals who meet the specified qualifications and using sources and procedures that assure compliance with local and international regulations and license conditions. Instruments for measuring exposure rates are calibrated for linearity of response on all useful ranges. Instruments used for contamination surveys are calibrated for detection efficiencies for various nuclides, as well as for linearity of response. Instruments that are used for making quantitative in vitro or in vivo measurements of radioactivity for determination of radiation doses, concentrations of radioactivity in effluents, or for verification of other aspects of regulatory compliance, shall be calibrated at regular intervals, as appropriate for the particular instrument. Operating instructions, either supplied by the manufacturer or prepared by the user, shall be maintained in a manner that would allow a competent individual to use the equipment properly, even on an irregular basis. Dose calibrators shall be checked for linearity, geometrical variation and accuracy at the time of installation. Linearity tests shall be performed quarterly. The accuracy and precision of each dose calibrator shall be checked daily with NBS-traceable standards, e.g. Co-57, Ba-133 and Cs 137. The daily readings shall be recorded on a log sheet; if not within 5% of the comparable reading obtained previously, the instrument shall be adjusted, recalibrated or removed from service for repair. All appropriate tests shall be repeated following repair or adjustment of a Calibrator, depending upon the nature of the adjustment or repair.</p>

<h2>5.8: Transportation and shipping of radioactive materials</h2>
<p>Radioactive materials of any kind, transported on public roads or off SAEC property by other than SAEC personnel using SAEC vehicles, shall be packaged and labeled in compliance with Sudan transportation regulations. Radioactive materials may be shipped from the SAEC to another organization or individual only after verification by the IBC that all transfer, packaging, labeling and transportation requirements have been met. To assure that all requirements for shipment are met, and that appropriate records are maintained, a written authorization form and one or more check lists shall be prepared by the individual responsible for the shipment and approved by the BSO before the shipment is made. The instructions and forms for various applications are contained in Radiation Procedures and Records related to those applications.</p>
<h2>5.9: Radioactive wastes management</h2>
<p>All users of radioactive materials shall be instructed in the requirements for segregation and labeling of radioactive wastes. They shall also be encouraged to prevent the unnecessary generation of all radioactive wastes, particularly mixed waste, and to minimize the quantities of those wastes that are unavoidable. Radioactive waste materials must be properly segregated, packaged and labeled by the user prior to collection for disposal. For the safety of all personnel involved in radioactive waste disposal, users must take all reasonable precautions to deactivate, detoxify and neutralize hazardous waste materials. All radioactive waste materials must be prepared and labeled properly before they will be picked up for disposal; wastes found to be improperly prepared or labeled may be returned to the user for reprocessing or repackaging under the supervision of the RSO. Radioactive wastes (radwastes) shall be collected, stored, packaged, shipped and disposed of in accordance with all pertinent local and international regulations. The RSO shall prepare and maintain procedures for handling radwastes that will ensure the protection of the employees involved in such duties and keep all radiation exposures ALARA. Specifications for segregation and packaging of radwastes shall be based on specific regulations or regulatory guidance, and include a record-keeping system that will allow complete tracking and accounting for all radwastes shipped to a disposal site or disposed of locally. Special attention shall be directed to the minimization of mixed wastes and solid wastes containing long-lived radionuclides.  For radwaste management purposes, any nuclide with a half-life of more than 100 days is considered "long-lived." Radioactive wastes (radwastes) shall be collected, stored, packaged, shipped and disposed of in accordance with all pertinent local and international regulations. The RSO shall prepare and maintain procedures for handling radwastes that will ensure the protection of the employees involved in such duties and keep all radiation exposures ALARA. The BSO shall also maintain records that allow complete tracking and accounting for all radwastes shipped to a disposal site or disposed of locally. </p>

<h2>3.5: ACCEDENT/INCIDENT RESPONSE: </h2>
<h3>3.5.1: ACCIDENTS RESULTING IN PERSONAL INJURY</h3>
<p>1.	Call 0183-432500 for emergency response as soon as possible.</p>
<p>2.	Do not remove equipment involved in the accident and do not move it unless necessary to provide aid to the victim(s) or to prevent further damage or injury.</p>
<p>3.	Depending on the seriousness of the injuries, a formal accident investigation may be required in compliance with Ministry of Labor regulations.</p>

<h3>3.5.2: ACCIDENTS RESULTING IN PERSONAL CHEMICAL EXPOSURE:</h3>
<p>1.	If a hazardous chemical is in someone’s eyes, flush eyes for at least 15 minutes in the eyewash, holding the victim’s eyelids open. Call 0183-432500 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>2.	If a toxic or corrosive chemical is on someone’s skin, flush area affected for at least 15 minutes. If necessary, use the safety shower and remove contaminated apparel. </p>
<p>a.	For hydrofluoric acid, when calcium gluconate treatment is available, instead flush skin for five minutes and immediately apply the calcium gluconate.</p>
<p>3.	Call 0183-432500 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>4.	If a person is exposed to a toxic material in the air, remove the person to fresh air and call 0183-432500 as soon as possible. Do not re-enter an area that may still be contaminated.</p>
<p>5.	All personnel in the laboratory should be able to retrieve an MSDS/SDS for any hazardous chemical in the laboratory so they can bring it to the emergency room.</p>
<p>6.	Transport the victim by ambulance.</p>
<p>7.	Contact the OSHO at (091231111) if there is a concern about possible long-term health effects from a workplace exposure.</p>
<p>8.	Reporting: After immediate, emergency actions have been taken, report the accident or incident to the work area supervisor, department administrator, CSO, or other designated department contact as soon as possible. If the accident results in a fatality or hospitalization, also report the accident immediately to Ministry of Labor at 091231111.</p>
<p>9.	An employee who seeks medical treatment for a work related injury or illness must submit Medical Treatment Report Form obtain from OSHO, which is initiated by the health care provider. </p>

<h3>3.5.3: FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS:</h3>
<p>1.	Activate the alarm system</p>
<p>2.	Evacuate as soon as possible</p>
<p>3.	You may attempt to use an appropriate fire extinguisher to fight the fire if it is easily extinguished (i.e., smaller than a trashcan)</p>
<p>4.	If a person’s hair or clothing is on fire, smother the flames with a coat or by having the person roll on the floor.</p>
<p>5.	Call 0183-432500 and provide first aid.</p>
<p>6.	Assist to evacuate as needed.</p>
<p>7.	Remain in contact with emergency responders.</p>
<p>8.	Reporting: Report all fires and explosions immediately, even if the fire is small or contained, to police station on (999) and to OSHO on 091231111.</p>

<h3>3.5.4: SPILLS:</h3>
<h4>A.	If a spill endangers people outside your workplace (such as if a toxic gas could go down the hall, or a flammable solvent spill might catch on fire):</h4>
<p>1.	Pull the nearest fire alarm to initiate evacuation of your building. Pulling the alarm will also call the local police and fire departments who will respond to the spill. </p>
<p>2.	Evacuate immediately. </p>
<p>3.	If you are able (i.e., if you are not injured or assisting someone else), make yourself available to describe the situation to emergency personnel when they arrive. </p>
<h4>B.	If a spill endangers people within your lab room:</h4>
<p>1.	Evacuate the room.</p>
<p>2.	Shutting down any flame producing equipment if possible. </p>
<p>3.	Report the situation to your PI, CE, SV and/or CSO as soon as possible. </p>
<p>4.	Keep people from re-entering the room. </p>
<p>5.	If the chemical is volatile and the laboratory has a fume hood or other ventilation exhaust system, it may be possible to let the chemical evaporate. Otherwise, a spill cleanup as procedure may be necessary. </p>

<h4>C.	Responding to Exposures:</h4>
<p>If the spill caused or is likely to cause an injury or illness:</p>
<p>1.	Call 0183-432500 and/or CSO at 091231111. </p>
<p>2.	In all cases, explain your circumstances to the CSO. </p>
<p>3.	Injured personnel should be transported by trained medics and not volunteers. </p>

<h4>D.	Spill Cleanup:</h4>
<p>		1.	If you know what the chemical is and its hazards, and have appropriate PPE and spill cleanup materials, clean up the spill using care</p>
<p>		2.	If you are unable to clean up the spill due to lack of knowledge or materials, call OSHO at 091231111. OSHO may call the hazardous materials response contractor if you cannot clean up your spill. All clean-up costs are paid by the responsible department or laboratory. </p>
<p>		3.	A spill of a highly-volatile chemical outside a fume hood may be handled best by preventing access to the laboratory and simply allowing the chemical to evaporate, especially if the laboratory has an operating fume hood. </p>
<p>		4.	A large spill of a toxic, low-volatility chemical (such as 500 milliliters of formaldehyde or 20 milliliters of mercury) that occurs outside of a fume hood may be especially problematic. Evacuate the room and call OSHO at 091231111 before attempting to clean up these types of spills. Even if you were approved for use of a respirator for that particular material prior to the spill, it may not provide adequate protection. </p>

<h4>E.	Spill Waste:  </h4>
<p>Waste generated during spill cleanup is usually hazardous waste. There are a few exceptions, such as neutralized and absorbed acid spills. </p>
<p>1.	Place hazardous spill waste in double plastic bags or the plastic bucket, label as hazardous waste, and initiate a Chemical Collection Request. </p>
<p>2.	If you have nonhazardous spill waste, double bag it, tie the bags closed, and label it as non-hazardous waste. Put it in the trash or next to it for Custodial Services to collect.</p>

<h4>F.	Documentation and Process Improvement </h4>
<p>1.	Fill out an accident report with your supervisor. </p>
<p>2.	Replace used clean-up materials. </p>
<p>3.	Determine if additional or other types of cleanup materials would be desirable. </p>
<p>4.	Discuss as a group what could have been done differently. </p>

<h4>G.	Mercury Spills:</h4>
<p>1.	Mercury may enter the body through skin or eye contact, but inhalation is the more serious exposure route, especially if the spill involves heated mercury.</p>
<p>2.	Because metallic mercury vaporizes very slowly at room temperatures, mercury exposure will probably not be a health concern as long as the mercury is completely cleaned up. </p>
<p>3.	It is nearly impossible to clean up mercury spills on soft surfaces such as carpeting and shoes and typically requires removal and disposal of these contaminated items as hazardous waste. </p>
<p>4.	While cleaning the spill, extreme care must be taken to prevent personnel from stepping on spilled mercury or spreading the spill to un-contaminated areas. </p>
<p>5.	Personnel must be trained in spill clean-up and use appropriate techniques and materials. </p>
<p>6.	Advice about spill clean-up can be obtained from OSHO at 091231111.</p>
<p>7.	Laboratories/sections with mercury or mercury-containing equipment should have a mercury spill kit immediately available.</p>

<h3>3.5.5: GAS LEAKS OR OTHER ODORS </h3>
<h4>3.5.5.1: NATURAL GAS LEAKS </h4>
<h4>A.	Natural gas leaks are a potential cause of explosions. Natural gas contains an odorant that enables recognition even at low concentrations. If you smell natural gas in the laboratory, do the following: </h4>
<p>1.	Turn off all sources of ignition (open flames, electrical equipment.) </p>
<p>2.	Check laboratory gas outlets for open valves. </p>
<p>3.	Call OSHO, CSO at 091231111</p>
<h4>B.	For strong, widespread and/or quickly worsening odor: </h4>
<p>1.	Pull the emergency alarm at a pull station. </p>
<p>2.	Turn off all sources of ignition (open flames, electrical equipment). </p>
<p>3.	Close the emergency gas valve for your floor or area if one exists. </p>
<p>4.	Evacuate the building immediately and go to your assembly area. </p>
<p>5.	If your assembly area is downwind of the building, move to an alternate assembly area up wind at least 300 feet from the building. </p>
<p>6.	Do not return to an evacuated building unless told to do so by the on-scene authority (fire department, police department or safety personnel). </p>

<h4>3.5.5.2: LEAKING GAS CYLINDERS </h4>
<h4>A.	Do not over-tighten the valve in an attempt to stop the leak. </h4>
<h4>B.	If the valve continues to leak, consider whether room evacuation and building evacuation is necessary. </h4>
<h4>C.	Take the following actions as appropriate: </h4>
<p>1.	Flammable, oxidizing or inert gases: </p>
<p>a.	Wear PPE as necessary.</p>
<p>b.	If possible, allow the cylinder to exhaust into a well ventilated area (such as a fume hood) with few or no combustible absorbent materials in the vicinity (such as cardboard). </p>
<p>c.	Post a sign warning of the leaking cylinder. Avoid sparks and open flames. </p>
<p>2.	Toxic or corrosive gases :</p>
<p>a.	Wear PPE as necessary. </p>
<p>b.	Exhaust cylinder into an absorbent or neutralizer if possible. </p>
<p>c.	If no absorbent or neutralizing system is available, exhaust the cylinder into an operating fume hood. </p>
<p>d.	If escaping gas is leaking out of the control device or no control device is available, evacuate the area. </p>
<p>e.	Post a sign warning of the leaking cylinder. </p>

<h4>3.5.5.3: UNKNOWN ODORS </h4>
<h4>A.	Check with co-workers to determine if they are doing something to produce an odor. </h4>
<h4>B.	If not, check adjacent labs to determine if the odor is widespread or if the source is obvious. </h4>
<h4>C.	Try to relate the odor to possible causes, such as whether it smells like a sewer, or rotting food, or over-heating electronics, or a distinct chemical. </h4>
<h4>D.	If the source is obvious, take action if possible to eliminate the cause or control the odor, such as taking a chemical reaction off the bench-top and putting it into a working fume hood. </h4>
<h4>E.	If the odor isn’t immediately found but appears to be appreciably stronger in one location, there is likely a source nearby, which can be</h4>
<p>1.	A dried sink drain or floor drain (if a sewer-like or chemical-like odor).</p>
<p>2.	A chemical process gone wrong (if a rotting or unknown chemical odor).</p>
<p>3.	Over-heating electronics (if devices are over-heating).</p>
<p>4.	A chemical spill or a leaking process (if a distinct chemical). </p>
<p>5.	There are an unlimited number of potential sources, but familiarity with the lab’s activities should help narrow the possibilities. </p>

<h3>3.5.6: UTILITY OUTAGE </h3>
<p>The safety of you and those around you is the first consideration during a utility outage. </p>
<p>1.	Remain calm. </p>
<p>2.	Assess the situation; if conditions seem dangerous, evacuate the area while assisting others to evacuate. </p>
<p>3.	Do not re-enter the building until competent authority has determined it is safe to do so. </p>
<p>4.	If the situation does not seem dangerous:</p>
<p>a.	Notify your supervisor or the building coordinator of the failure.</p>
<p>b.	Shut off work in progress that could cause hazards.</p>
<p>c.	Close containers and fume hood/biosafety cabinet sashes, and return hazardous material containers to their proper storage locations. </p>
<p>d.	Some utility failures may have insignificant impact on your operations and you can safely continue work as determined by you and your department/supervisor. </p>
<p>e.	Note: emergency lighting systems are meant to provide light for exiting, not routine work. </p>
<p>5.	If the failure appears likely to last for a long period:</p>
<p>a.	Follow your health and safety plan and directions of your department/supervisor. </p>
<p>b.	Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed for as long as possible and implement backup procedures as necessary, such as obtaining dry ice to keep specimen refrigerators cold. </p>
<p>6.	When systems return to normal operation, immediately assess the work area (even on weekends if that is when service is restored) for any hazards that may be present, such as electric devices (heaters, ovens, centrifuges, etc.) left on when the outage occurred. </p>

<h4>3.5.6.1: ELECTRICAL FAILURE PROCEDURES </h4>
<p>1.	Assess the extent of the outage in your area. </p>
<p>2.	Help co-workers in darkened work areas move to safe locations. </p>
<p>3.	Implement pre-planned response actions, as necessary. </p>
<p>4.	Do not treat the outage as “business as usual.” </p>
<p>5.	If practical, secure current experimental work, and then move it to a safe location. </p>
<p>6.	Close any open containers of hazardous materials.</p>
<p>7.	Close sashes on fume hoods and biological safety cabinets. </p>
<p>8.	If you move chemicals on carts between floors, get assistance. Hazardous spills are a significant risk during transport. </p>
<p>9.	Keep refrigerators or freezers closed throughout the outage. </p>
<p>10.	Unplug personal computers, non-essential electrical equipment, and appliances. </p>
<p>11.	Open windows for additional light and ventilation (during mild weather). </p>
<p>12.	If you are asked to evacuate your building, secure any hazardous materials work and leave the building. </p>
<p>13.	To obtain information about a prolonged outage, listen to service announcements in the local media or call the service provider. </p>
<p>14.	Release personnel during an extended outage if directed to do so by the department director. </p>
<p>15.	When power is restored, immediately assess the affected area for potentially hazardous situations, such as devices left “on.” This is also required if power is restored at a time that the facility would be normally unoccupied. </p>

<h4>3.5.6.2: HVAC/FUME HOOD FAILURE PROCEDURES </h4>
<p>1.	Notify other occupants of the situation. </p>
<p>2.	If necessary (e.g., because smoke is coming into the room), evacuate area (and pull fire alarm if the situation is widespread) </p>
<p>3.	Notify your supervisor or building coordinator of the situation. </p>
<p>4.	Shut down work in progress if safe to do so: </p>
<p>a.	Shut off equipment and supplied gases and liquids </p>
<p>b.	Close open containers </p>
<p>c.	Close sashes on fume hoods, biological safety cabinets </p>
<p>d.	Note the step in your process when work was stopped</p>
<p>e.	Return specimens to freezer, storage containers, etc. </p>
<p>5.	Open windows if staff are to remain in the workplace. </p>
<p>6.	If staff remain in the workplace, periodically check on their wellbeing and evacuate if anyone is adversely affected. </p>
<p>7.	Prior to re-starting work in the area, review work to identify possible hazards. </p>
<p>8.	If the outage caused damage, submit an accident damage report to OSHO.</p>

<h3>3.5.7: FLOODS </h3>
<p>1.	If your laboratory is flooded, find the source of the water. Shut the water off.</p>
<p>2.	If safe, also shut down any equipment that could cause a dangerous electrical situation during a flood. </p>
<p>3.	Cover equipment and desks if water is dripping onto them. </p>
<p>4.	Then, get help quickly. </p>
<p>5.	During work hours, contact your building coordinator. Safety officer at 091231111.</p>
<p>6.	If the water is contaminated by chemicals, call CSO at 091231111</p>
<p>7.	The best method to clean up uncontaminated water is by using one water vacuum on the scene of the flood and another on the affected area below. Saturated materials (fabrics and cardboard, for example) need to be dried within 48 hours or will need to be discarded to prevent mold growth. </p>
<p>8.	After the cleanup, submit an accident report to OSHO.</p>
  
<h2>3.6: LABORATORY EQUIPMENTS: </h2>
<h3>3.6.1: FIRE SAFETY EQUIPMENTS:</h3>
<h4>A.	Flammable Liquid Storage Cabinets</h4>
<p>1.	Flammable liquid storage cabinets are required if you are storing over ten gallons of flammable liquids.</p>
<p>2.	Flammable liquid storage cabinets are not fireproof. Cabinets are designed to protect the contents from extreme temperatures for a limited time only.</p>
<p>3.	Contact OSHO at 0912311111 for further information on flammable liquid storage cabinets.</p>
<p>4.	Cabinets must be labeled "Flammable - Keep Fire Away"</p>
<p>5.	Do not over fill cabinets. Check manufacturer’s recommendations for storage limits.</p>
<p>6.	All bottles should be placed on the shelves, never stacked. Keep all containers tightly closed.</p>
<p>7.	Do not store incompatible chemicals in these cabinets.</p>
<p>8.	Cabinet doors should never be propped open unless the mechanism is a designed part of an approved cabinet.</p>
<p>9.	There should be a secondary containment on each shelf and at the bottom of the unit. These plastic or rubber trays retain spills.</p>
<p>10.	Tops of cabinets are not storage shelves. Do not store combustible materials on or beside these cabinets.</p>
<h4>B.	Flammable Storage Refrigerators</h4>
<p>1.	 Flammable chemicals or chemical mixtures that need to be stored below room temperature must be stored in flammable material storage refrigerators or freezers specifically designed by the manufacturer to have non-sparking interiors.</p>
<p>2.	All laboratory refrigerators and freezers must be prominently labeled with a warning sign indicating whether it can be used for flammable or non-flammable storage.</p>

<h3>3.6.2: FUME HOOD:</h3>
<h4>A.	A fume hood is ventilation equipment that vents separately from the building’s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.</h4>
<h4>B.	It is the primary means of controlling airborne chemical exposure is a fume hood.</h4>
<h4>C.	Should be used when working with toxic compounds or compounds with a boiling point below 120C. (However, some aqueous solutions may be an exception to this rule.) It may be necessary to use a closed system such as a glove box or bag for highly hazardous chemical materials.</h4>
<h4>D.	Using fume hood:</h4>
<p>1.	Training: Personnel using fume hoods should take training class on how to use fume hood.</p>
<p>2.	Verify Operation: Make sure the fume hood is operating before starting work. Some new fume hoods have monitoring devices that indicate acceptable working conditions.</p>
<p>3.	Exhaust Fan Speed: Some older buildings have fume hoods equipped with two speed exhaust fans with local control at the hood. The low exhaust setting is only appropriate for storage. The high setting provides protection for working with chemicals.</p>
<p>4.	Minimize Cross Drafts and Eddy Currents: </p>
<p>a.	Air flow into the fume hood is adversely affected by cross drafts and eddy currents. </p>
<p>b.	Cross drafts occur when people walk in front of a fume hood or when nearby windows or doors are open. Eddy currents occur around the person using the fume hood and around objects inside it. </p>
<p>c.	To limit these effects, fume hoods should not contain unnecessary objects and the slots within the fume hood which direct air flow must not be blocked. </p>
<p>d.	The slot at the rear of the work surface is essential for proper air movement. If large pieces of equipment or large numbers of bottles are placed in front of the slot, they should be raised up on blocks or placed on a shelf to allow air to flow into the slot.</p>
<p>e.	Equipment should be placed as far to the back of the fume hood as practical.</p>
<p>f.	Work should be performed at least six inches inside the fume hood opening to prevent cross drafts and eddy currents from pulling contaminated air out of the fume hood and into the room. </p>
<p>5.	Sliding Sashes:  The sash should be kept as low as possible to improve overall performance of the hood. The more closed the sash is, the better protection from an unexpected chemical reaction. Procedures should be done with the sash at the level of the maximum approved sash height marking or lower. Use a separate safety shield, such as a face shield, when working with an open sash.</p>
<p>6.	Chemical Evaporation: It is illegal to evaporate chemicals in the hood to “dispose” of them. Any open apparatus used in hoods which emit large volumes of volatile chemicals should be fitted with condensers, traps, or scrubbers to contain and collect hazardous vapors or dusts. </p>
<p>7.	Storage: Do not store chemicals or supplies in the fume hood. Chemicals and supplies should be stored in approved cabinets. </p>
<p>8.	Flammable Liquid Vapor: Laboratory fume hoods are designed to reduce flammable vapors below lower explosive limits when properly operated and maintained. As an added precaution, use only non-sparking and explosion proof electrical equipment (hot plates, stirring plates, and centrifuges) in fume hoods where a large volume of flammable liquid vapor may be generated. Take care with flammable liquids and heat sources. </p>
<p>9.	Containers: All containers of chemicals must be securely capped when not in use. A rule of thumb is that containers should be open for minutes at the most – which is the maximum time it normally takes to pour a small amount of chemical into another container and cap them. All containers must be labeled with the chemical identity and appropriate hazard warnings (or the material must be used up during the work period and the material must be under continuous control of the researcher using it).</p>
<h4>E.	Testing Fume Hood Performance:</h4>
<p>1.	Face Velocity: </p>
<p>a.	Standard Flow Hoods: 80 – 120 Feet Per Minute (FPM). Sash height should not be less than 18 inches. </p>
<p>b.	High Performance Hoods: 60 – 84 FPM.</p>
<p>2.	VAV Tracking: The sash is lowered about 50% from the target sash height to assure the HVAC system responds appropriately to maintain optimal capture velocity. </p>
<p>3.	3) Sound: Measure sound using a sound meter on Scale A with the sash optimized and the sound meter located about one foot from the front of the hood at 18 inches above the work surface (roughly ear level of the testing technician). The ambient sound level must be less than 80 dBA. </p>
<p>4.	Containment Test: Using visual powder or dry ice, check for effective containment. </p>
<p>5.	Monitor Alarm Properly Functioning: </p>
<p>a.	Confirm that the monitor has power and that it is properly calibrated. Raise the sash to reduce the face velocity below 80 LFM (60 LFM for low flow hoods) and to confirm that both the visible and audible alarm signals function. </p>
<p>b.	Test the monitor’s mute function by pressing the mute button. Test the reset button. </p>
<p>c.	This test fails if the monitor fails to alarm, is more than 10 FPM out of calibration, or if it fails any functional test or is damaged. </p>

<h3>3.6.3: LAMINAR FLOW HOODS </h3>
<p>Laminar flow hoods are designed to protect the work surface from contaminants and blow out into the face of the person using the hood. Therefore, any chemical use will cause the person to be exposed to the chemical. Toxic or volatile chemicals may not be used in a laminar flow hood. </p>
<h3>3.6.4: DUCTLESS LABORATORY HOODS </h3>
<h4>A.	This type device uses special filters or absorbents to clean the contaminated air in the hood prior to re-circulating the air back into the room. </h4>
<h4>B.	Recirculation of potentially contaminated air into the room presents special dangers and special requirements must be met. </h4>
<h4>C.	The requesting department must demonstrate that the following concerns are addressed as long as the hood is in use:</h4>
<p>1.	Chemical Characterization: </p>
<p>a.	Each of the chemicals to be used in the ductless hood must be completely characterized as to the quantity which may be released within the hood at one time and the frequency of use. </p>
<p>b.	The hood manufacturer will need this information for the design of the hood. Once designed, use of other chemicals in the hood must be forbidden unless the hood manufacturer approves the alternate chemical. </p>
<p>c.	Records as to the design of the hood and the designated chemical usage must be maintained in the laboratory. </p>
<p>2.	Ductless Hood Approval </p>
<p>a.	The Principal Investigator (PI) must verify that the size, shape, and layout of the proposed hood as offered by the hood manufacturer is appropriate for the intended use. </p>
<p>b.	The PI must also develop a management plan for the hood which addresses staff training, procedures for using the hood including emergency procedures, ongoing maintenance and certifications for the hood, and recordkeeping. This plan needs to assure continuity if management of the hood is taken over by another individual. </p>
<p>3.	Laboratory Staff Information and Training </p>
<p>a.	All personnel in the laboratory must be trained as to the fact that the ductless hood re-circulates air back into the room, that only certain, designated chemicals may be used within the hood, and that failure to operate properly and maintain the hood may result in personnel exposures. </p>
<p>b.	Also, a sign must be placed on the hood identifying which chemicals may be used and warning that the air is re-circulated back into the room from the hood.</p>

<h3>3.7.1: GENERAL LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT </h3>
<h4>A.	Floors and Walkways </h4>
<p>1.	Flooring: </p>
<p>a.	Floors should be level, with no protuberances which could cause a tripping hazard. </p>
<p>b.	Openings in the floor should be covered, if possible, or else protected or guarded to prevent falls. </p>
<p>c.	If impervious mats are present, they should have a non-slip backing or be fastened to prevent moving when someone </p>
<p>d.	steps on them. Material spills should be cleaned up as soon as possible. </p>
<p>2.	Obstructions: </p>
<p>a.	Equipment and supplies should not be placed where it would impede exit, either during normal operations (such as a file drawer which may open into an aisle) or in case of equipment failure (such as chemical reactions escaping a fume hood placed at the entrance to a room). </p>
<p>b.	Hoses and electrical cords should be strung along the ceiling instead of crossing aisles on the floor. </p>

<h4>B.	Plumbing Systems </h4>
<p>1.	Place a strainer or mesh pad over all sink drains to prevent objects falling into the plumbing.</p>
<p>2.	Piping systems and plumbing connections in a room should be labeled. Such plumbing systems may include sewage lines, potable water lines, non-potable water systems, cryogenic and pressurized gases, or other systems. </p>
<p>3.	All personnel should know what to do in case of a leak in any system.</p>
<p>4.	If experimental procedures will require connecting laboratory apparatus to any plumbing, personnel must also know how to avoid improper connections (i.e., avoiding mistakes such as connecting to the wrong system or making an inappropriate cross connection). </p>
<p>5.	Public Health regulations require additional safe guards to the plumbing system when connecting chemical equipment or experiments to potable water systems. Check with OSHO and Facilities Services prior to any connections to potable water systems.</p>

<h4>C.	Lighting</h4>
<p>1.	Light Fixtures: </p>
<p>a.	Light fixtures should be operational and diffusers should be installed. </p>
<p>b.	If emergency lighting and exit signs are not functional, immediately initiate a work request with Facilities Services. </p>
<p>2.	Lighting Intensities: </p>
<p>a.	Light intensities should be adequate for the tasks being performed.</p>
<p>b.	If lighting seems inadequate when all fixtures are working, consider obtaining additional fixtures, especially if the laboratory arrangement is temporary.</p>
<p>c.	If this will not resolve the problem, call OSHO at 0912311111. </p>
<p>d.	In a few cases, increased lighting may be required to reduce potential hazards from activities such as laser use or ultraviolet light applications. In these unusual situations, contact Radiation Safety Officer at 0912311111. </p>

<h4>D.	Noise and Vibration </h4>
<p>1.	If possible, equipment that produces irritating noise and vibration should be replaced with equipment designed to produce less noise and vibration. </p>
<p>2.	If equipment in the area is producing noise levels that require people to raise their voices to be heard while standing next to each other, potentially hazardous noise levels are being produced. These levels can be evaluated by contacting OSHO. </p>
<p>3.	Equipment should not be purchased which produces noise levels greater than 80 dBA without specific written approval from OSHO. </p>
<p>4.	A formal hearing protection program may need to be implemented for the installation and use of such equipment. </p>

<h4>E.	Indoor Air Quality </h4>
<p>1.	Occupant Activities: </p>
<p>a.	Many complaints about odors are due to occupant generated problems. Such sources include dried out drain traps in sinks and floor drains, chemical spills inside a laboratory or adjacent area, rotting food within a room, and expected or unexpected chemical reactions creating a stench. </p>
<p>b.	The room occupants should check these potential problems. If a dry trap is suspected, the trap should be filled with a few hundred milliliters of water at least once a month, or infrequently pour ten or twenty milliliters of a slower evaporating chemical such as glycerin, propylene glycol (not ethylene glycol) or mineral oil into the drain. </p>

<p>2.	Facility Related:</p>
<p>a.	Recurring poor indoor air quality may be due to inadequate or malfunctioning general HVAC systems. </p>
<p>b.	In some cases, odors may come from a leak in a plumbing system (such as natural gas or sewage), an open drain that was never capped by Facilities Services when a piece of equipment was decommissioned, or a construction project in an adjacent area. </p>
<p>c.	If these conditions are suspected, contact Facilities Services </p>
<p>d.	If an unknown odor persists, contact OSHO.</p>

<h4>F.	Asbestos, Lead and Other Hazardous Facility Components </h4>
<p>1.	Asbestos:</p>
<p>a.	Asbestos may be found in various building components (often in plumbing insulation and fireproofing, and sometimes in floor tiles, ceiling tiles, wall finishes and other building materials). </p>
<p>b.	Asbestos may also be found in various equipment components (such as fume hood and safety cabinet wallboard and in autoclave and oven gaskets) and various supplies such as heat resistant gloves and heat-resistant cloth. </p>
<p>c.	Non-asbestos materials should be used whenever possible in place of the asbestos materials and all personnel should avoid damaging suspected asbestos-containing materials. </p>
<p>d.	Do NOT use an ordinary vacuum cleaner or dry sweep to clean up suspect dust from these materials. </p>
<p>e.	Contact OSHO at 09123111111 concerning asbestos questions. </p>

<p>2.	Lead: </p>
<p>a.	As a building or equipment component, lead is frequently found in old paints on walls and metal surfaces, in paints used on the exterior of ships and buildings, as a barrier when density is needed (such as in an x-ray radiation shield) or as a weight when a heavy material is needed (such as an equipment counter balance). </p>
<p>b.	The primary health hazard would come from inhaling or ingesting dusts from these materials, but skin contact with these materials should also be minimized. </p>
<p>c.	If a laboratory operation routinely creates lead dusts or melts lead, the process should be evaluated by OSHO. </p>

<p>3.	Other Building Materials:</p>
<p>a.	Other structural materials that could present a health hazard include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fluorescent light fixtures and transformers, liquid mercury switches in piped gas systems, mercury in fluorescent and high pressure light bulbs, flammable or toxic gases in piped gas systems, and potentially hazardous materials in sewage plumbing and ventilation ducts. </p>
<p>b.	If any leak of such material is suspected, contact Facilities Services.</p>
 
<h4>G.	Building Repairs and Alterations:</h4>
<p>1.	Building occupants are not authorized to repair or alter facilities. </p>
<p>2.	Facility problems such as broken flooring and broken electrical cover plates should be corrected by initiating a work request with Facilities Services.</p>

<h3>3.7.2: ELECTRICAL HAZARDS </h3>
<h4>A.	Circuit Breaker Access </h4>
<p>1.	Access: Maintain at least three feet clearance in front of any circuit breaker panels within the laboratory. </p>
<p>2.	Utility Access in Other Rooms: If you must enter other rooms to access the circuit breakers, you must be observant of any conditions in that room which may indicate a hazard. Such conditions could include puddles in front of the circuit breaker box or temporarily barriers preventing entry to the circuit breaker box. (If a barrier is deliberately placed, such as a sign indicating that entry is restricted due to some hazard, obtain permission placing the barrier before entry.) </p>

<h4>B.	Permanent Wiring and Outlets </h4>
<p>1.	Request permanent wiring be installed for situations when you would be using extension cords for periods longer than eight hours. </p>
<p>2.	All building electrical repairs and wiring must be done by Facilities Services.</p>
<p>3.	If conduits appear damaged or cover plates over electrical outlet boxes are damaged or missing, please report that information to the Facilities Services </p>


<h4>C.	Equipment Cords and Extension Cords </h4>
<p>1.	Extension cords should be a minimum of 14 gauge size (heavy duty) and be in good condition with no splices, knots, deterioration, taping, damage, or sharp, permanent bends. Plugs (110 volt) must have three prongs with a grounding prong longer than the current prongs. </p>
<p>2.	Extension cords may never be used in place of permanent wiring. Consider instead power strip outlets or surge protectors with build-in circuit breakers. </p>
<p>3.	Carpeting, heavy objects, and equipment that may abrade or melt an electrical cord should never be placed on top of electrical cords. Cords should serve only one fixture or piece of equipment. Cords should never be strung through holes in walls or ceilings, or over metal fixtures such as pipes or equipment racks because cord movement may abrade the cord. </p>

<h4>D.	Chemical Splashes into Electrical Equipment </h4>
<p>1.	Place equipment so as to reduce the chances of a spill of water or chemical on the equipment. </p>
<p>2.	If a spill occurs while the equipment is unplugged, the spill should be promptly cleaned, and the equipment must be inspected before power is applied. </p>

<h4>E.	Grounding </h4>
<p>1.	Equipment must be properly grounded (using three prong plugs for 110 volt power), especially in “wet” areas. </p>
<p>2.	Electrical outlets in “wet” areas must have ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs). (However, these devices only interrupt flow of electricity to ground and may not stop flow of electricity when completing an electric circuit with two “live” wires.) </p>

<h4>F.	Equipment Modifications </h4>
<p>1.	Any problems with electrically powered equipment should be brought to the attention of the PI or laboratory supervisor. </p>
<p>2.	If equipment setup is modified, someone knowledgeable with the apparatus should check the new setup, before power is applied. </p>
<p>3.	Equipment operators must understand the hazards of equipment and apparatus in use and be familiar with the correct operation of that equipment. </p>
<p>4.	Power line cords should be unplugged before any modifications or repairs are made to equipment. </p>
<p>5.	Even though power may need to be applied to equipment while calibrations are performed, the operator must remain wary of the energized state of the equipment and not adjust the equipment beyond safe operational parameters. </p>
<p>6.	If there is a potential for a worker to contact live electrical circuits of 50 volts or greater while performing equipment installation, modification or maintenance, that person must take electrical safety classes including lockout/tagout procedures and wear appropriate arc/flash protective clothing. </p>
<p>7.	If at all possible, equipment setup and maintenance must be performed with the equipment in a de-energized condition.</p>

<h3>3.7.3: EQUIPMENT GUARDS AND MOUNTING </h3>
<h4>A.	Guards </h4>
<p>Belts, pulleys, and other exposed moving equipment parts must be guarded. Equipment covers should be in place. </p>
<h4>B.	Instruction Manuals </h4>
<p>Operator manuals should be available. Workers using the equipment should know where such manuals can be found and should review the manuals prior to using the equipment. </p>
<h4>C.	Mounting </h4>
<p>Equipment designed to be used in a particular location should be permanently fixed in place to prevent movement from vibration or earthquake. This is especially important for equipment which may topple (e.g., a drill press) or which needs to be balanced (e.g., a centrifuge). </p>


<h2>3.8: CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT</h2>
<h3>3.8.1: CHEMICAL INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h3>
<h4>A.	Chemical Inventory Management System, a chemical tracking system, has been developed.</h4>
<h4>B.	Personnel must inventory all chemicals found in the laboratory and specify the maximum amount normally found at this location. </h4>
<h4>C.	Dilutions and reagents prepared in the lab for further work do not need to be added to the inventory, but must have a container label applied unless the preparation will be all used or disposed that day. </h4>
<h4>D.	Review and update inventories annually and whenever there are significant changes in your chemical inventory, such as when you are moving a laboratory or starting a new project.</h4>
<h4>E.	Chemicals that are expired, in bad shape or no longer needed must be managed as hazardous chemical waste. </h4>

<h3>3.8.2: MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET/SAFETY DATA SHEET (MSDS/SDS)</h3>
<h4>A.	Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) and Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) are documents that describe the physical and health hazards of chemicals.</h4>
<h4>B.	Manufacturers of chemicals must provide MSDSs/SDSs for chemicals that they sell.</h4>
<h4>C.	Staff and students must have ready access to MSDSs/SDSs for all chemicals used in the laboratory.</h4>
<h4>D.	Paper copies of MSDSs/SDSs for the hazardous chemicals most likely to spill and/or cause injury to someone should be maintained available and accessible. Having an MSDS/SDS immediately available when someone has been exposed to a hazardous chemical helps emergency personnel decide how to respond and treat that person</h4>
<h4>E.	Call OSHO at 0912311111 to request assistance locating or accessing MSDSs/SDSs during business hours.</h4>
<h4>F.	If an MSDS/SDS is received with a chemical shipment please maintain a copy in the lab, and send the original to OSHO.</h4>

<h3>3.8.3: CHEMICAL PROCUREMENT AND STORAGE:</h3>
<h4>3.8.3.1: CHEMICAL PROCUREMENT</h4>
<h4>A.	Order only the amount of chemicals needed. Many manufacturers will supply smaller quantities or containers if requested by the purchaser. Do not stockpile chemicals. </h4>
<h4>B.	Chemicals that are expired and/or appear to be no longer useful are considered hazardous waste. </h4>
<h4>C.	Purchase hazardous chemicals in plastic coated bottles (when available) instead of uncoated glass bottles. </h4>
<h4>D.	If possible, hazardous chemicals should be received directly by the laboratory. If it is received in an office, there should be a safe location such as a designated table with adequate open space reserved for temporary storage of the package. </h4>
<h4>E.	When you open a shipment, you should verify that the proper chemical was sent, that the container is intact, and that the label is legible. The date of receipt should be written on the container’s label. </h4>
<h4>F.	Materials that are extremely hazardous to property, health or the environment (explosives, pyrophoric materials, highly water reactive chemicals, and highly toxic gases, for examples) must not be procured until the necessary permits and administrative, engineering and environmental controls are in place. </h4>
<h4>G.	Whenever possible gas cylinders should be purchased through the preferred supplier, to ensure that the supplier has a cylinder return authorization program.</h4>

<h4>3.8.3.1: CHEMICAL STORAGE</h4>
<h4>A.	Segregate Incompatibles </h4>
<p>1.	To avoid dangerous interactions among incompatible chemicals, chemicals should be physically segregated using incompatible chemicals scheme </p>
<p>2.	Consideration should also be given to using compatible materials for containers, tubing, and reaction vessels. </p>
<p>3.	You can contact OSHO at 0912311111 for additional information about chemical hazard classes and compatible storage and several compatibility guides </p>

<h4>B.	General Chemical Storage Guidelines </h4>
<p>1.	Follow good storage practices no matter wherever the chemicals are stored (i.e. cabinets, refrigerators, or shelves). </p>
<p>2.	Some general, good practices are described in Table below:</p>
<img src="images/table 301.png">
<p>Flammables	Store in approved safety cans or cabinets. Keep away from any source of ignition: heat, sparks, or open flames. Also see section D.3 below. </p>
<p>Light Sensitive Chemicals 	Store in amber bottles in a cool, dry, dark place. </p>
<p>Nitrated compounds 	Nitrated compounds can be considered explosive; special care and handling may be required. </p>
<p>Oxidizers 	Store in a cool dry place. </p>
<p>Peroxidizable Chemicals 	Store in airtight containers in a dark and cool place. Most peroxidizable compounds are flammable and should be stored in a flammable liquid storage cabinet or room. Label containers with receiving, and opening dates. Periodically test for the presence of peroxides. Discard before exceeding expiration date. </p>
<p>Pyrophoric Substances 	(Materials that will react with the air to ignite when exposed, e.g., tert-butyl lithium.) Store in a cool dry place, making provisions for an airtight seal </p>
<p>Toxic Chemicals 	Store according to the nature of the chemical, using appropriate security where necessary. </p>
<p>Water Reactive Chemicals 	Store in a cool dry place away from any water source. Have a Class D fire extinguisher available in case of fire. </p>
<p>Flammables. 	Store in approved safety cans or cabinets. Keep away from any source of ignition: heat, sparks, or open flames. </p>
	
<h4>C.	Good Storage Practices </h4>
<p>1.	Cabinets: Whenever practical, chemicals should be stored in approved cabinets. </p>
<p>2.	Shelves: All shelves should be securely anchored to walls and fitted with 2-inch lipped edges or enclosed in cabinets with latched doors. </p>
<p>3.	Heavy Objects: Heavy objects should be stored on lower shelves. </p>
<p>4.	Corrosives: Corrosives should be stored only below eye level. </p>
<p>5.	Secondary Containment: Use secondary containment to prevent incompatible chemicals from mixing and reacting with each other if they must be stored together. This can be done by placing and storing chemical containers inside plastic bins.  Secondary containment or spill control (such as placing the container on an absorbent pad) is generally required for containers on the floor. </p>
<p>6.	Consistent Chemical Storage Locations - Particularly hazardous substances (highly dangerous or toxic chemicals, select carcinogens, mutagens, and teratogens) should be stored together if compatible. Signs should be posted indicating their location and unique hazards. </p>
<p>7.	High Degree of Toxicity: Chemicals with a high degree of toxicity (e.g. venoms, mycotoxins, and select agents) should be doubly contained and stored in a locked area accessible only by authorized personnel. Use containers that are chemically resistant and non-breakable. </p>
<p>8.	Chemical Waste: Store chemical wastes following the same guidelines as above. Original container labels must be obliterated and the containers must be labeled Secondary containment is required if chemical waste is stored near a floor drain or other drain to sanitary sewer. Avoid mixing incompatible waste materials. </p>
<p>9.	Storage in Refrigerators or Freezers: Laboratories must use properly designed refrigerators or freezers if such appliances are used for storing volatile flammables. The refrigerator/freezer must be certified by the manufacturer for flammable materials storage. More expensive, “explosion-proof” appliances are usually not required for the typical laboratory setting. </p>
<p>10.	If containers are placed on refrigerator/freezer door shelves, use secondary containers, additional barriers, velcro or other protective measures to keep them from falling out when the door is opened. There have been many accidents from small bottles stored on refrigerator door shelves falling over, slipping under the shelf bar, and breaking on the floor when the door was opened.</p>

<h4>D.	Incorrect Storage Practices </h4>
<p>1.	Acids - Do not store inorganic acids with flammable solvents, flammable acids or combustibles (such as cardboard). Contact of a concentrated oxidizing acid with a flammable solvent may result in a fire or an explosion. </p>
<p>2.	Heat/Direct Sunlight - Exposure of chemicals to heat or direct sunlight should be avoided. Even if the chemical is stable, plastic containers have degraded from sunlight. </p>
<p>3.	Storage on Floors, on Bench Tops or in Fume Hoods: Chemicals should not be stored on the floor or be so numerous as to clutter bench top work areas. Storing more than a few chemicals in a fume hood will compromise the effectiveness of the hood unless they are stored on a shelf a few inches above the work surface of the fume hood (so that air can enter the slot at the back of the work surface). </p>
<p>4.	Storage Height: Do not store heavy containers on the floor or above waist level. Do not store corrosives above eye level. Do not store items closer than 18 inches from the ceiling if the area has fire sprinklers. </p>
<p>5.	Hallway Storage: Do not store chemicals in hallways, corridors and exit ways. </p>
<p>6.	Storage In or Under Sinks: Chemicals (except cleaners) should not be stored under the sink, near the sink or in the sink, to minimize the chance of accidents and improper discharges to the sanitary sewer.</p>

<h4>E.	Chemical Storage Quantity Limits </h4>
<p>1.	Chemical quantities in most institutions buildings are limited </p>
<p>2.	Limits by hazardous material classification apply to a control zone that may include a suite of laboratories, one or more floors in a building, or the entire building. </p>
<p>3.	There are also outdoor control areas for storage of hazardous materials. </p>
<p>4.	Quantity limits may be increased if fire sprinklers protect the entire control area or, in some cases, if hazardous materials are in approved cabinets. </p>
<p>5.	Researchers and other building occupants must cooperate with each other to make sure that hazardous material quantities do not exceed code limits.</p>
<p>6.	Flammable liquids are also limited in basement rooms to comply with the International Fire Code.</p>
<p>7.	In a laboratory, a maximum of 10 gallons of flammable liquids, in approved containers, may be stored outside of a flammable liquid cabinet. See bellow table:</p>
<img src="images/table 302.png">

<p>2.	The exterior of the containers to be moved should be clean enough that they could be handled without the need for protective gloves. </p>
<p>3.	Chemical containers must be labeled and securely closed. Lecture bottles should be packed in a manner that protects the valve. </p>
<p>4.	Chemicals should be grouped by compatibility and by hazard class (e.g., flammable, toxic, etc.) and each group should be placed in larger containers or tubs while being transported. </p>
<p>5.	Containers used to transport multiple chemicals should be lined with an absorbent material such as vermiculite to cushion the load and absorb and contain any spills. Multiple glass bottles in the same tub should be cushioned using the absorbent to prevent the bottles from rattling against each other. </p>
<p>6.	Carts used to move chemicals should be stable under the load and have wheels large enough to negotiate uneven surfaces without tipping or stopping suddenly. </p>

<h4>C.	Compressed Gas Cylinders </h4>
<p>When moving compressed gas cylinders, they must: </p>
<p>1.	Have the metal outlet cap/plug installed, </p>
<p>2.	Have the valve cap installed if the cylinder has one, and </p>
<p>3.	Be secured in a cart or container designed to prevent the cylinder from falling over while being moved.</p>

<h3>3.9.2: Off-Institutional Transport:</h3>
<h4>A.	Vehicle Use:</h4>
<p>1.	You cannot transport hazardous chemicals in your personal vehicles without prior authorization by the OSHO.</p>
<p>2.	Certain hazardous materials can be transported the institutional operated vehicle.</p>
